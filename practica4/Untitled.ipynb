      "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of\n",
      "wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it\n",
      "was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the\n",
      "season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of\n",
      "despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were\n",
      "all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way--in\n",
      "short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its\n",
      "noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for\n",
      "evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the\n",
      "throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with\n",
      "a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer\n",
      "than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes,\n",
      "that things in general were settled for ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.\n",
      "Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period,\n",
      "as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth\n",
      "blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had\n",
      "heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were\n",
      "made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane\n",
      "ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its\n",
      "messages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally\n",
      "deficient in originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the\n",
      "earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People,\n",
      "from a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange\n",
      "to relate, have proved more important to the human race than any\n",
      "communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane\n",
      "brood.\n",
      "\n",
      "France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her\n",
      "sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down\n",
      "hill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her\n",
      "Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane\n",
      "achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue\n",
      "torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not\n",
      "kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks\n",
      "which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty\n",
      "yards. It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and\n",
      "Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death,\n",
      "already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into\n",
      "boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in\n",
      "it, terrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses\n",
      "of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were\n",
      "sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with\n",
      "rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which\n",
      "the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of\n",
      "the Revolution. But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work\n",
      "unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about\n",
      "with muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion\n",
      "that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.\n",
      "\n",
      "In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to\n",
      "justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and\n",
      "highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night;\n",
      "families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing\n",
      "their furniture to upholsterers’ warehouses for security; the highwayman\n",
      "in the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and\n",
      "challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of\n",
      "“the Captain,” gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the\n",
      "mail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and\n",
      "then got shot dead himself by the other four, “in consequence of the\n",
      "failure of his ammunition:” after which the mail was robbed in peace;\n",
      "that magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand\n",
      "and deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the\n",
      "illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London\n",
      "gaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law\n",
      "fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball;\n",
      "thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at\n",
      "Court drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles’s, to search\n",
      "for contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the\n",
      "musketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences\n",
      "much out of the common way. In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy\n",
      "and ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing\n",
      "up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on\n",
      "Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the\n",
      "hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of\n",
      "Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer,\n",
      "and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer’s boy of\n",
      "sixpence.\n",
      "\n",
      "All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close\n",
      "upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.\n",
      "Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded,\n",
      "those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the\n",
      "fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights\n",
      "with a high hand. Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred\n",
      "and seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small\n",
      "creatures--the creatures of this chronicle among the rest--along the\n",
      "roads that lay before them.\n",

      "CHAPTER II.\n",
      "The Mail\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November,\n",
      "before the first of the persons with whom this history has business.\n",
      "The Dover road lay, as to him, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up\n",
      "Shooter’s Hill. He walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail,\n",
      "as the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish\n",
      "for walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill,\n",
      "and the harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the\n",
      "horses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the\n",
      "coach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back\n",
      "to Blackheath. Reins and whip and coachman and guard, however, in\n",
      "combination, had read that article of war which forbade a purpose\n",
      "otherwise strongly in favour of the argument, that some brute animals\n",
      "are endued with Reason; and the team had capitulated and returned to\n",
      "their duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "With drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way through\n",
      "the thick mud, floundering and stumbling between whiles, as if they were\n",
      "falling to pieces at the larger joints. As often as the driver rested\n",
      "them and brought them to a stand, with a wary “Wo-ho! so-ho-then!” the\n",
      "near leader violently shook his head and everything upon it--like an\n",
      "unusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got up the\n",
      "hill. Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a\n",
      "nervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its\n",
      "forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding\n",
      "none. A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the\n",
      "air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the\n",
      "waves of an unwholesome sea might do. It was dense enough to shut out\n",
      "everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings,\n",
      "and a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed\n",
      "into it, as if they had made it all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the\n",
      "side of the mail. All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the\n",
      "ears, and wore jack-boots. Not one of the three could have said, from\n",
      "anything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was\n",
      "hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from\n",
      "the eyes of the body, of his two companions. In those days, travellers\n",
      "were very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody on\n",
      "the road might be a robber or in league with robbers. As to the latter,\n",
      "when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in\n",
      "“the Captain’s” pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable\n",
      "non-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards. So the guard\n",
      "of the Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November, one\n",
      "thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooter’s Hill, as\n",
      "he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet,\n",
      "and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a\n",
      "loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols,\n",
      "deposited on a substratum of cutlass.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected\n",
      "the passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they\n",
      "all suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but\n",
      "the horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have\n",
      "taken his oath on the two Testaments that they were not fit for the\n",
      "journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wo-ho!” said the coachman. “So, then! One more pull and you’re at the\n",
      "top and be damned to you, for I have had trouble enough to get you to\n",
      "it!--Joe!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Halloa!” the guard replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What o’clock do you make it, Joe?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ten minutes, good, past eleven.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My blood!” ejaculated the vexed coachman, “and not atop of Shooter’s\n",
      "yet! Tst! Yah! Get on with you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The emphatic horse, cut short by the whip in a most decided negative,\n",
      "made a decided scramble for it, and the three other horses followed\n",
      "suit. Once more, the Dover mail struggled on, with the jack-boots of its\n",
      "passengers squashing along by its side. They had stopped when the coach\n",
      "stopped, and they kept close company with it. If any one of the three\n",
      "had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead\n",
      "into the mist and darkness, he would have put himself in a fair way of\n",
      "getting shot instantly as a highwayman.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill. The horses\n",
      "stopped to breathe again, and the guard got down to skid the wheel for\n",
      "the descent, and open the coach-door to let the passengers in.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tst! Joe!” cried the coachman in a warning voice, looking down from his\n",
      "box.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you say, Tom?”\n",
      "\n",
      "They both listened.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I say a horse at a canter coming up, Joe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ say a horse at a gallop, Tom,” returned the guard, leaving his hold\n",
      "of the door, and mounting nimbly to his place. “Gentlemen! In the king’s\n",
      "name, all of you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "With this hurried adjuration, he cocked his blunderbuss, and stood on\n",
      "the offensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "The passenger booked by this history, was on the coach-step, getting in;\n",
      "the two other passengers were close behind him, and about to follow. He\n",
      "remained on the step, half in the coach and half out of; they remained\n",
      "in the road below him. They all looked from the coachman to the guard,\n",
      "and from the guard to the coachman, and listened. The coachman looked\n",
      "back and the guard looked back, and even the emphatic leader pricked up\n",
      "his ears and looked back, without contradicting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring\n",
      "of the coach, added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet\n",
      "indeed. The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to\n",
      "the coach, as if it were in a state of agitation. The hearts of the\n",
      "passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard; but at any rate, the\n",
      "quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath, and holding\n",
      "the breath, and having the pulses quickened by expectation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So-ho!” the guard sang out, as loud as he could roar. “Yo there! Stand!\n",
      "I shall fire!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The pace was suddenly checked, and, with much splashing and floundering,\n",
      "a man’s voice called from the mist, “Is that the Dover mail?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never you mind what it is!” the guard retorted. “What are you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_Is_ that the Dover mail?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why do you want to know?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I want a passenger, if it is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What passenger?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Jarvis Lorry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name. The guard,\n",
      "the coachman, and the two other passengers eyed him distrustfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Keep where you are,” the guard called to the voice in the mist,\n",
      "“because, if I should make a mistake, it could never be set right in\n",
      "your lifetime. Gentleman of the name of Lorry answer straight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is the matter?” asked the passenger, then, with mildly quavering\n",
      "speech. “Who wants me? Is it Jerry?”\n",
      "\n",
      "(“I don’t like Jerry’s voice, if it is Jerry,” growled the guard to\n",
      "himself. “He’s hoarser than suits me, is Jerry.”)\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Mr. Lorry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is the matter?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A despatch sent after you from over yonder. T. and Co.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know this messenger, guard,” said Mr. Lorry, getting down into the\n",
      "road--assisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the other two\n",
      "passengers, who immediately scrambled into the coach, shut the door, and\n",
      "pulled up the window. “He may come close; there’s nothing wrong.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope there ain’t, but I can’t make so ‘Nation sure of that,” said the\n",
      "guard, in gruff soliloquy. “Hallo you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well! And hallo you!” said Jerry, more hoarsely than before.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come on at a footpace! d’ye mind me? And if you’ve got holsters to that\n",
      "saddle o’ yourn, don’t let me see your hand go nigh ’em. For I’m a devil\n",
      "at a quick mistake, and when I make one it takes the form of Lead. So\n",
      "now let’s look at you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying mist,\n",
      "and came to the side of the mail, where the passenger stood. The rider\n",
      "stooped, and, casting up his eyes at the guard, handed the passenger\n",
      "a small folded paper. The rider’s horse was blown, and both horse and\n",
      "rider were covered with mud, from the hoofs of the horse to the hat of\n",
      "the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Guard!” said the passenger, in a tone of quiet business confidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The watchful guard, with his right hand at the stock of his raised\n",
      "blunderbuss, his left at the barrel, and his eye on the horseman,\n",
      "answered curtly, “Sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is nothing to apprehend. I belong to Tellson’s Bank. You must\n",
      "know Tellson’s Bank in London. I am going to Paris on business. A crown\n",
      "to drink. I may read this?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If so be as you’re quick, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He opened it in the light of the coach-lamp on that side, and\n",
      "read--first to himself and then aloud: “‘Wait at Dover for Mam’selle.’\n",
      "It’s not long, you see, guard. Jerry, say that my answer was, RECALLED\n",
      "TO LIFE.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jerry started in his saddle. “That’s a Blazing strange answer, too,”\n",
      " said he, at his hoarsest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Take that message back, and they will know that I received this, as\n",
      "well as if I wrote. Make the best of your way. Good night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With those words the passenger opened the coach-door and got in; not at\n",
      "all assisted by his fellow-passengers, who had expeditiously secreted\n",
      "their watches and purses in their boots, and were now making a general\n",

      "of it, for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close, and were of a\n",
      "fine texture; his shoes and buckles, too, though plain, were trim. He\n",
      "wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig, setting very close to his\n",
      "head: which wig, it is to be presumed, was made of hair, but which\n",
      "looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass.\n",
      "His linen, though not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings,\n",

      "When Mr. Lorry had finished his breakfast, he went out for a stroll on\n",
      "the beach. The little narrow, crooked town of Dover hid itself away\n",
      "from the beach, and ran its head into the chalk cliffs, like a marine\n",
      "ostrich. The beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling\n",
      "wildly about, and the sea did what it liked, and what it liked was\n",
      "destruction. It thundered at the town, and thundered at the cliffs, and\n",
      "brought the coast down, madly. The air among the houses was of so strong\n",
      "a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be\n",
      "dipped in it, as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea. A little\n",
      "fishing was done in the port, and a quantity of strolling about by\n",
      "night, and looking seaward: particularly at those times when the tide\n",
      "made, and was near flood. Small tradesmen, who did no business whatever,\n",
      "sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes, and it was remarkable\n",
      "that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter.\n",

      "As the day declined into the afternoon, and the air, which had been\n",
      "at intervals clear enough to allow the French coast to be seen, became\n",

      "too. When it was dark, and he sat before the coffee-room fire, awaiting\n",

      "ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has\n",

      "others, directed by lookers-on up at high windows, darted here and\n",
      "there, to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new\n",
      "directions; others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee-dyed\n",
      "pieces of the cask, licking, and even champing the moister wine-rotted\n",
      "fragments with eager relish. There was no drainage to carry off the\n",
      "wine, and not only did it all get taken up, but so much mud got taken up\n",
      "along with it, that there might have been a scavenger in the street,\n",
      "if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous\n",
      "presence.\n",
      "\n",
      "A shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices--voices of men, women,\n",
      "and children--resounded in the street while this wine game lasted. There\n",
      "was little roughness in the sport, and much playfulness. There was a\n",
      "special companionship in it, an observable inclination on the part\n",
      "of every one to join some other one, which led, especially among the\n",
      "luckier or lighter-hearted, to frolicsome embraces, drinking of healths,\n",
      "shaking of hands, and even joining of hands and dancing, a dozen\n",
      "together. When the wine was gone, and the places where it had been\n",
      "most abundant were raked into a gridiron-pattern by fingers, these\n",
      "demonstrations ceased, as suddenly as they had broken out. The man who\n",
      "had left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cutting, set it in\n",
      "motion again; the women who had left on a door-step the little pot of\n",
      "hot ashes, at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own\n",
      "starved fingers and toes, or in those of her child, returned to it; men\n",
      "with bare arms, matted locks, and cadaverous faces, who had emerged into\n",
      "the winter light from cellars, moved away, to descend again; and a gloom\n",
      "gathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than sunshine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wine was red wine, and had stained the ground of the narrow street\n",
      "in the suburb of Saint Antoine, in Paris, where it was spilled. It had\n",
      "stained many hands, too, and many faces, and many naked feet, and many\n",
      "wooden shoes. The hands of the man who sawed the wood, left red marks\n",
      "on the billets; and the forehead of the woman who nursed her baby, was\n",
      "stained with the stain of the old rag she wound about her head again.\n",
      "Those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask, had acquired a\n",
      "tigerish smear about the mouth; and one tall joker so besmirched, his\n",
      "head more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than in it, scrawled\n",
      "upon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wine-lees--BLOOD.\n",
      "\n",
      "The time was to come, when that wine too would be spilled on the\n",
      "street-stones, and when the stain of it would be red upon many there.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now that the cloud settled on Saint Antoine, which a momentary\n",
      "gleam had driven from his sacred countenance, the darkness of it was\n",
      "heavy--cold, dirt, sickness, ignorance, and want, were the lords in\n",
      "waiting on the saintly presence--nobles of great power all of them;\n",
      "but, most especially the last. Samples of a people that had undergone a\n",
      "terrible grinding and regrinding in the mill, and certainly not in the\n",
      "fabulous mill which ground old people young, shivered at every corner,\n",
      "passed in and out at every doorway, looked from every window, fluttered\n",
      "in every vestige of a garment that the wind shook. The mill which\n",
      "had worked them down, was the mill that grinds young people old; the\n",
      "children had ancient faces and grave voices; and upon them, and upon the\n",
      "grown faces, and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh,\n",
      "was the sigh, Hunger. It was prevalent everywhere. Hunger was pushed out\n",
      "of the tall houses, in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and\n",
      "lines; Hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and wood and\n",
      "paper; Hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of\n",
      "firewood that the man sawed off; Hunger stared down from the smokeless\n",
      "chimneys, and started up from the filthy street that had no offal,\n",
      "among its refuse, of anything to eat. Hunger was the inscription on the\n",
      "baker’s shelves, written in every small loaf of his scanty stock of\n",
      "bad bread; at the sausage-shop, in every dead-dog preparation that\n",
      "was offered for sale. Hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting\n",
      "chestnuts in the turned cylinder; Hunger was shred into atomics in every\n",
      "farthing porringer of husky chips of potato, fried with some reluctant\n",
      "drops of oil.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its abiding place was in all things fitted to it. A narrow winding\n",
      "street, full of offence and stench, with other narrow winding streets\n",
      "diverging, all peopled by rags and nightcaps, and all smelling of rags\n",
      "and nightcaps, and all visible things with a brooding look upon them\n",
      "that looked ill. In the hunted air of the people there was yet some\n",
      "wild-beast thought of the possibility of turning at bay. Depressed and\n",
      "slinking though they were, eyes of fire were not wanting among them; nor\n",
      "compressed lips, white with what they suppressed; nor foreheads knitted\n",
      "into the likeness of the gallows-rope they mused about enduring, or\n",
      "inflicting. The trade signs (and they were almost as many as the shops)\n",
      "were, all, grim illustrations of Want. The butcher and the porkman\n",
      "painted up, only the leanest scrags of meat; the baker, the coarsest of\n",
      "meagre loaves. The people rudely pictured as drinking in the wine-shops,\n",
      "croaked over their scanty measures of thin wine and beer, and were\n",
      "gloweringly confidential together. Nothing was represented in a\n",
      "flourishing condition, save tools and weapons; but, the cutler’s knives\n",
      "and axes were sharp and bright, the smith’s hammers were heavy, and the\n",
      "gunmaker’s stock was murderous. The crippling stones of the pavement,\n",
      "with their many little reservoirs of mud and water, had no footways, but\n",
      "broke off abruptly at the doors. The kennel, to make amends, ran down\n",
      "the middle of the street--when it ran at all: which was only after heavy\n",
      "rains, and then it ran, by many eccentric fits, into the houses. Across\n",
      "the streets, at wide intervals, one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and\n",
      "pulley; at night, when the lamplighter had let these down, and lighted,\n",
      "and hoisted them again, a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly\n",
      "manner overhead, as if they were at sea. Indeed they were at sea, and\n",
      "the ship and crew were in peril of tempest.\n",
      "\n",
      "For, the time was to come, when the gaunt scarecrows of that region\n",
      "should have watched the lamplighter, in their idleness and hunger, so\n",
      "long, as to conceive the idea of improving on his method, and hauling\n",
      "up men by those ropes and pulleys, to flare upon the darkness of their\n",
      "condition. But, the time was not come yet; and every wind that blew over\n",
      "France shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain, for the birds, fine of\n",
      "song and feather, took no warning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wine-shop was a corner shop, better than most others in its\n",
      "appearance and degree, and the master of the wine-shop had stood outside\n",
      "it, in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches, looking on at the struggle\n",
      "for the lost wine. “It’s not my affair,” said he, with a final shrug\n",
      "of the shoulders. “The people from the market did it. Let them bring\n",
      "another.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There, his eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up his joke,\n",
      "he called to him across the way:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say, then, my Gaspard, what do you do there?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance, as is often\n",
      "the way with his tribe. It missed its mark, and completely failed, as is\n",
      "often the way with his tribe too.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What now? Are you a subject for the mad hospital?” said the wine-shop\n",
      "keeper, crossing the road, and obliterating the jest with a handful of\n",
      "mud, picked up for the purpose, and smeared over it. “Why do you write\n",
      "in the public streets? Is there--tell me thou--is there no other place\n",
      "to write such words in?”\n",
      "\n",
      "In his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand (perhaps accidentally,\n",
      "perhaps not) upon the joker’s heart. The joker rapped it with his\n",
      "own, took a nimble spring upward, and came down in a fantastic dancing\n",
      "attitude, with one of his stained shoes jerked off his foot into his\n",
      "hand, and held out. A joker of an extremely, not to say wolfishly\n",
      "practical character, he looked, under those circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Put it on, put it on,” said the other. “Call wine, wine; and finish\n",
      "there.” With that advice, he wiped his soiled hand upon the joker’s\n",
      "dress, such as it was--quite deliberately, as having dirtied the hand on\n",
      "his account; and then recrossed the road and entered the wine-shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "This wine-shop keeper was a bull-necked, martial-looking man of thirty,\n",
      "and he should have been of a hot temperament, for, although it was a\n",
      "bitter day, he wore no coat, but carried one slung over his shoulder.\n",
      "His shirt-sleeves were rolled up, too, and his brown arms were bare to\n",
      "the elbows. Neither did he wear anything more on his head than his own\n",
      "crisply-curling short dark hair. He was a dark man altogether, with good\n",
      "eyes and a good bold breadth between them. Good-humoured looking on\n",
      "the whole, but implacable-looking, too; evidently a man of a strong\n",
      "resolution and a set purpose; a man not desirable to be met, rushing\n",
      "down a narrow pass with a gulf on either side, for nothing would turn\n",
      "the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge, his wife, sat in the shop behind the counter as he\n",
      "came in. Madame Defarge was a stout woman of about his own age, with\n",
      "a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything, a large hand\n",
      "heavily ringed, a steady face, strong features, and great composure of\n",
      "manner. There was a character about Madame Defarge, from which one might\n",
      "have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself\n",
      "in any of the reckonings over which she presided. Madame Defarge being\n",
      "sensitive to cold, was wrapped in fur, and had a quantity of bright\n",
      "shawl twined about her head, though not to the concealment of her large\n",
      "earrings. Her knitting was before her, but she had laid it down to pick\n",
      "her teeth with a toothpick. Thus engaged, with her right elbow supported\n",
      "by her left hand, Madame Defarge said nothing when her lord came in, but\n",
      "coughed just one grain of cough. This, in combination with the lifting\n",
      "of her darkly defined eyebrows over her toothpick by the breadth of a\n",
      "line, suggested to her husband that he would do well to look round the\n",
      "shop among the customers, for any new customer who had dropped in while\n",
      "he stepped over the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wine-shop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about, until they\n",
      "rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady, who were seated in\n",
      "a corner. Other company were there: two playing cards, two playing\n",
      "dominoes, three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply\n",
      "of wine. As he passed behind the counter, he took notice that the\n",
      "elderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady, “This is our man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What the devil do _you_ do in that galley there?” said Monsieur Defarge\n",
      "to himself; “I don’t know you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But, he feigned not to notice the two strangers, and fell into discourse\n",
      "with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How goes it, Jacques?” said one of these three to Monsieur Defarge. “Is\n",
      "all the spilt wine swallowed?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Every drop, Jacques,” answered Monsieur Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "When this interchange of Christian name was effected, Madame Defarge,\n",
      "picking her teeth with her toothpick, coughed another grain of cough,\n",
      "and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is not often,” said the second of the three, addressing Monsieur\n",
      "Defarge, “that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine, or\n",
      "of anything but black bread and death. Is it not so, Jacques?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is so, Jacques,” Monsieur Defarge returned.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this second interchange of the Christian name, Madame Defarge, still\n",
      "using her toothpick with profound composure, coughed another grain of\n",
      "cough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last of the three now said his say, as he put down his empty\n",
      "drinking vessel and smacked his lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! So much the worse! A bitter taste it is that such poor cattle\n",
      "always have in their mouths, and hard lives they live, Jacques. Am I\n",
      "right, Jacques?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are right, Jacques,” was the response of Monsieur Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "This third interchange of the Christian name was completed at the moment\n",
      "when Madame Defarge put her toothpick by, kept her eyebrows up, and\n",
      "slightly rustled in her seat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold then! True!” muttered her husband. “Gentlemen--my wife!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The three customers pulled off their hats to Madame Defarge, with three\n",
      "flourishes. She acknowledged their homage by bending her head, and\n",
      "giving them a quick look. Then she glanced in a casual manner round the\n",
      "wine-shop, took up her knitting with great apparent calmness and repose\n",
      "of spirit, and became absorbed in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gentlemen,” said her husband, who had kept his bright eye observantly\n",
      "upon her, “good day. The chamber, furnished bachelor-fashion, that you\n",
      "wished to see, and were inquiring for when I stepped out, is on the\n",
      "fifth floor. The doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard\n",
      "close to the left here,” pointing with his hand, “near to the window of\n",
      "my establishment. But, now that I remember, one of you has already been\n",
      "there, and can show the way. Gentlemen, adieu!”\n",
      "\n",
      "They paid for their wine, and left the place. The eyes of Monsieur\n",
      "Defarge were studying his wife at her knitting when the elderly\n",
      "gentleman advanced from his corner, and begged the favour of a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Willingly, sir,” said Monsieur Defarge, and quietly stepped with him to\n",
      "the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their conference was very short, but very decided. Almost at the first\n",
      "word, Monsieur Defarge started and became deeply attentive. It had\n",
      "not lasted a minute, when he nodded and went out. The gentleman then\n",
      "beckoned to the young lady, and they, too, went out. Madame Defarge\n",
      "knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows, and saw nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Jarvis Lorry and Miss Manette, emerging from the wine-shop thus,\n",
      "joined Monsieur Defarge in the doorway to which he had directed his own\n",
      "company just before. It opened from a stinking little black courtyard,\n",
      "and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses, inhabited\n",
      "by a great number of people. In the gloomy tile-paved entry to the\n",
      "gloomy tile-paved staircase, Monsieur Defarge bent down on one knee\n",
      "to the child of his old master, and put her hand to his lips. It was\n",
      "a gentle action, but not at all gently done; a very remarkable\n",
      "transformation had come over him in a few seconds. He had no good-humour\n",
      "in his face, nor any openness of aspect left, but had become a secret,\n",
      "angry, dangerous man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is very high; it is a little difficult. Better to begin slowly.”\n",
      " Thus, Monsieur Defarge, in a stern voice, to Mr. Lorry, as they began\n",
      "ascending the stairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is he alone?” the latter whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alone! God help him, who should be with him!” said the other, in the\n",
      "same low voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is he always alone, then?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of his own desire?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of his own necessity. As he was, when I first saw him after they\n",
      "found me and demanded to know if I would take him, and, at my peril be\n",
      "discreet--as he was then, so he is now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is greatly changed?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Changed!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The keeper of the wine-shop stopped to strike the wall with his hand,\n",
      "and mutter a tremendous curse. No direct answer could have been half so\n",
      "forcible. Mr. Lorry’s spirits grew heavier and heavier, as he and his\n",
      "two companions ascended higher and higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a staircase, with its accessories, in the older and more crowded\n",
      "parts of Paris, would be bad enough now; but, at that time, it was vile\n",
      "indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses. Every little habitation\n",
      "within the great foul nest of one high building--that is to say,\n",
      "the room or rooms within every door that opened on the general\n",
      "staircase--left its own heap of refuse on its own landing, besides\n",
      "flinging other refuse from its own windows. The uncontrollable and\n",
      "hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered, would have polluted\n",
      "the air, even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their\n",
      "intangible impurities; the two bad sources combined made it almost\n",
      "insupportable. Through such an atmosphere, by a steep dark shaft of dirt\n",
      "and poison, the way lay. Yielding to his own disturbance of mind, and to\n",
      "his young companion’s agitation, which became greater every instant, Mr.\n",
      "Jarvis Lorry twice stopped to rest. Each of these stoppages was made\n",
      "at a doleful grating, by which any languishing good airs that were left\n",
      "uncorrupted, seemed to escape, and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed\n",
      "to crawl in. Through the rusted bars, tastes, rather than glimpses, were\n",
      "caught of the jumbled neighbourhood; and nothing within range, nearer\n",
      "or lower than the summits of the two great towers of Notre-Dame, had any\n",
      "promise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, the top of the staircase was gained, and they stopped for the\n",
      "third time. There was yet an upper staircase, of a steeper inclination\n",
      "and of contracted dimensions, to be ascended, before the garret story\n",
      "was reached. The keeper of the wine-shop, always going a little in\n",
      "advance, and always going on the side which Mr. Lorry took, as though he\n",
      "dreaded to be asked any question by the young lady, turned himself about\n",
      "here, and, carefully feeling in the pockets of the coat he carried over\n",
      "his shoulder, took out a key.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The door is locked then, my friend?” said Mr. Lorry, surprised.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay. Yes,” was the grim reply of Monsieur Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think it necessary to turn the key.” Monsieur Defarge whispered it\n",
      "closer in his ear, and frowned heavily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why! Because he has lived so long, locked up, that he would be\n",
      "frightened--rave--tear himself to pieces--die--come to I know not what\n",
      "harm--if his door was left open.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it possible!” exclaimed Mr. Lorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it possible!” repeated Defarge, bitterly. “Yes. And a beautiful\n",
      "world we live in, when it _is_ possible, and when many other such things\n",
      "are possible, and not only possible, but done--done, see you!--under\n",
      "that sky there, every day. Long live the Devil. Let us go on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper, that not a word\n",
      "of it had reached the young lady’s ears. But, by this time she trembled\n",
      "under such strong emotion, and her face expressed such deep anxiety,\n",
      "and, above all, such dread and terror, that Mr. Lorry felt it incumbent\n",
      "on him to speak a word or two of reassurance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Courage, dear miss! Courage! Business! The worst will be over in a\n",
      "moment; it is but passing the room-door, and the worst is over. Then,\n",
      "all the good you bring to him, all the relief, all the happiness you\n",
      "bring to him, begin. Let our good friend here, assist you on that side.\n",
      "That’s well, friend Defarge. Come, now. Business, business!”\n",
      "\n",
      "They went up slowly and softly. The staircase was short, and they were\n",
      "soon at the top. There, as it had an abrupt turn in it, they came all at\n",
      "once in sight of three men, whose heads were bent down close together at\n",
      "the side of a door, and who were intently looking into the room to which\n",
      "the door belonged, through some chinks or holes in the wall. On hearing\n",
      "footsteps close at hand, these three turned, and rose, and showed\n",
      "themselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the\n",
      "wine-shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I forgot them in the surprise of your visit,” explained Monsieur\n",
      "Defarge. “Leave us, good boys; we have business here.”\n",

      "The three glided by, and went silently down.\n",
      "\n",
      "There appearing to be no other door on that floor, and the keeper of\n",
      "the wine-shop going straight to this one when they were left alone, Mr.\n",
      "Lorry asked him in a whisper, with a little anger:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you make a show of Monsieur Manette?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I show him, in the way you have seen, to a chosen few.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is that well?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ think it is well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who are the few? How do you choose them?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I choose them as real men, of my name--Jacques is my name--to whom the\n",

      "thing. Stay there, if you please, a little moment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With an admonitory gesture to keep them back, he stooped, and looked in\n",
      "through the crevice in the wall. Soon raising his head again, he struck\n",
      "twice or thrice upon the door--evidently with no other object than to\n",
      "make a noise there. With the same intention, he drew the key across it,\n",
      "three or four times, before he put it clumsily into the lock, and turned\n",
      "it as heavily as he could.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door slowly opened inward under his hand, and he looked into the\n",
      "room and said something. A faint voice answered something. Little more\n",
      "than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked back over his shoulder, and beckoned them to enter. Mr. Lorry\n",
      "got his arm securely round the daughter’s waist, and held her; for he\n",
      "felt that she was sinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-a-a-business, business!” he urged, with a moisture that was not of\n",
      "business shining on his cheek. “Come in, come in!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am afraid of it,” she answered, shuddering.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of it? What?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I mean of him. Of my father.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Rendered in a manner desperate, by her state and by the beckoning of\n",
      "their conductor, he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his\n",
      "shoulder, lifted her a little, and hurried her into the room. He sat her\n",
      "down just within the door, and held her, clinging to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Defarge drew out the key, closed the door, locked it on the inside,\n",
      "took out the key again, and held it in his hand. All this he did,\n",
      "methodically, and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he\n",
      "could make. Finally, he walked across the room with a measured tread to\n",
      "where the window was. He stopped there, and faced round.\n",
      "\n",
      "The garret, built to be a depository for firewood and the like, was dim\n",
      "and dark: for, the window of dormer shape, was in truth a door in the\n",
      "roof, with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from\n",
      "the street: unglazed, and closing up the middle in two pieces, like any\n",
      "other door of French construction. To exclude the cold, one half of this\n",
      "door was fast closed, and the other was opened but a very little way.\n",
      "Such a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means, that it\n",
      "was difficult, on first coming in, to see anything; and long habit\n",
      "alone could have slowly formed in any one, the ability to do any work\n",
      "requiring nicety in such obscurity. Yet, work of that kind was being\n",
      "done in the garret; for, with his back towards the door, and his face\n",
      "towards the window where the keeper of the wine-shop stood looking at\n",
      "him, a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very\n",
      "busy, making shoes.\n",

      "The Shoemaker\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good day!” said Monsieur Defarge, looking down at the white head that\n",
      "bent low over the shoemaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was raised for a moment, and a very faint voice responded to the\n",
      "salutation, as if it were at a distance:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good day!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are still hard at work, I see?”\n",
      "\n",
      "After a long silence, the head was lifted for another moment, and the\n",
      "voice replied, “Yes--I am working.” This time, a pair of haggard eyes\n",
      "had looked at the questioner, before the face had dropped again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful. It was not the\n",
      "faintness of physical weakness, though confinement and hard fare no\n",
      "doubt had their part in it. Its deplorable peculiarity was, that it was\n",
      "the faintness of solitude and disuse. It was like the last feeble echo\n",
      "of a sound made long and long ago. So entirely had it lost the life and\n",
      "resonance of the human voice, that it affected the senses like a once\n",
      "beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain. So sunken and\n",
      "suppressed it was, that it was like a voice underground. So expressive\n",
      "it was, of a hopeless and lost creature, that a famished traveller,\n",
      "wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness, would have remembered\n",
      "home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some minutes of silent work had passed: and the haggard eyes had looked\n",
      "up again: not with any interest or curiosity, but with a dull mechanical\n",
      "perception, beforehand, that the spot where the only visitor they were\n",
      "aware of had stood, was not yet empty.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I want,” said Defarge, who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker,\n",
      "“to let in a little more light here. You can bear a little more?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The shoemaker stopped his work; looked with a vacant air of listening,\n",
      "at the floor on one side of him; then similarly, at the floor on the\n",
      "other side of him; then, upward at the speaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What did you say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You can bear a little more light?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I must bear it, if you let it in.” (Laying the palest shadow of a\n",
      "stress upon the second word.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The opened half-door was opened a little further, and secured at that\n",
      "angle for the time. A broad ray of light fell into the garret, and\n",
      "showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap, pausing in his\n",
      "labour. His few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his\n",
      "feet and on his bench. He had a white beard, raggedly cut, but not very\n",
      "long, a hollow face, and exceedingly bright eyes. The hollowness and\n",
      "thinness of his face would have caused them to look large, under his yet\n",
      "dark eyebrows and his confused white hair, though they had been really\n",
      "otherwise; but, they were naturally large, and looked unnaturally so.\n",
      "His yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat, and showed his body\n",
      "to be withered and worn. He, and his old canvas frock, and his loose\n",
      "stockings, and all his poor tatters of clothes, had, in a long seclusion\n",
      "from direct light and air, faded down to such a dull uniformity of\n",
      "parchment-yellow, that it would have been hard to say which was which.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had put up a hand between his eyes and the light, and the very bones\n",
      "of it seemed transparent. So he sat, with a steadfastly vacant gaze,\n",
      "pausing in his work. He never looked at the figure before him, without\n",
      "first looking down on this side of himself, then on that, as if he had\n",
      "lost the habit of associating place with sound; he never spoke, without\n",
      "first wandering in this manner, and forgetting to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you going to finish that pair of shoes to-day?” asked Defarge,\n",
      "motioning to Mr. Lorry to come forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What did you say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you mean to finish that pair of shoes to-day?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t say that I mean to. I suppose so. I don’t know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But, the question reminded him of his work, and he bent over it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry came silently forward, leaving the daughter by the door. When\n",
      "he had stood, for a minute or two, by the side of Defarge, the shoemaker\n",
      "looked up. He showed no surprise at seeing another figure, but the\n",
      "unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he looked at\n",
      "it (his lips and his nails were of the same pale lead-colour), and then\n",
      "the hand dropped to his work, and he once more bent over the shoe. The\n",
      "look and the action had occupied but an instant.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have a visitor, you see,” said Monsieur Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What did you say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here is a visitor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The shoemaker looked up as before, but without removing a hand from his\n",
      "work.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come!” said Defarge. “Here is monsieur, who knows a well-made shoe when\n",
      "he sees one. Show him that shoe you are working at. Take it, monsieur.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry took it in his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is, and the maker’s name.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a longer pause than usual, before the shoemaker replied:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I forget what it was you asked me. What did you say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I said, couldn’t you describe the kind of shoe, for monsieur’s\n",
      "information?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is a lady’s shoe. It is a young lady’s walking-shoe. It is in the\n",
      "present mode. I never saw the mode. I have had a pattern in my hand.” He\n",
      "glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And the maker’s name?” said Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that he had no work to hold, he laid the knuckles of the right hand\n",
      "in the hollow of the left, and then the knuckles of the left hand in the\n",
      "hollow of the right, and then passed a hand across his bearded chin, and\n",
      "so on in regular changes, without a moment’s intermission. The task of\n",
      "recalling him from the vagrancy into which he always sank when he\n",
      "had spoken, was like recalling some very weak person from a swoon, or\n",
      "endeavouring, in the hope of some disclosure, to stay the spirit of a\n",
      "fast-dying man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you ask me for my name?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Assuredly I did.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“One Hundred and Five, North Tower.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is that all?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“One Hundred and Five, North Tower.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With a weary sound that was not a sigh, nor a groan, he bent to work\n",
      "again, until the silence was again broken.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are not a shoemaker by trade?” said Mr. Lorry, looking steadfastly\n",
      "at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "His haggard eyes turned to Defarge as if he would have transferred the\n",
      "question to him: but as no help came from that quarter, they turned back\n",
      "on the questioner when they had sought the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not a shoemaker by trade? No, I was not a shoemaker by trade. I-I\n",
      "learnt it here. I taught myself. I asked leave to--”\n",
      "\n",
      "He lapsed away, even for minutes, ringing those measured changes on his\n",
      "hands the whole time. His eyes came slowly back, at last, to the face\n",
      "from which they had wandered; when they rested on it, he started, and\n",
      "resumed, in the manner of a sleeper that moment awake, reverting to a\n",
      "subject of last night.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I asked leave to teach myself, and I got it with much difficulty after\n",
      "a long while, and I have made shoes ever since.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As he held out his hand for the shoe that had been taken from him, Mr.\n",
      "Lorry said, still looking steadfastly in his face:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monsieur Manette, do you remember nothing of me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The shoe dropped to the ground, and he sat looking fixedly at the\n",
      "questioner.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monsieur Manette”; Mr. Lorry laid his hand upon Defarge’s arm; “do you\n",
      "remember nothing of this man? Look at him. Look at me. Is there no old\n",
      "banker, no old business, no old servant, no old time, rising in your\n",
      "mind, Monsieur Manette?”\n",
      "\n",
      "As the captive of many years sat looking fixedly, by turns, at Mr.\n",
      "Lorry and at Defarge, some long obliterated marks of an actively intent\n",
      "intelligence in the middle of the forehead, gradually forced themselves\n",
      "through the black mist that had fallen on him. They were overclouded\n",
      "again, they were fainter, they were gone; but they had been there. And\n",
      "so exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her who\n",
      "had crept along the wall to a point where she could see him, and where\n",
      "she now stood looking at him, with hands which at first had been only\n",
      "raised in frightened compassion, if not even to keep him off and\n",
      "shut out the sight of him, but which were now extending towards him,\n",
      "trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm young\n",
      "breast, and love it back to life and hope--so exactly was the expression\n",
      "repeated (though in stronger characters) on her fair young face, that it\n",
      "looked as though it had passed like a moving light, from him to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Darkness had fallen on him in its place. He looked at the two, less and\n",
      "less attentively, and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the ground\n",
      "and looked about him in the old way. Finally, with a deep long sigh, he\n",
      "took the shoe up, and resumed his work.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you recognised him, monsieur?” asked Defarge in a whisper.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; for a moment. At first I thought it quite hopeless, but I have\n",
      "unquestionably seen, for a single moment, the face that I once knew so\n",
      "well. Hush! Let us draw further back. Hush!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She had moved from the wall of the garret, very near to the bench on\n",
      "which he sat. There was something awful in his unconsciousness of the\n",
      "figure that could have put out its hand and touched him as he stooped\n",
      "over his labour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a word was spoken, not a sound was made. She stood, like a spirit,\n",
      "beside him, and he bent over his work.\n",
      "\n",
      "It happened, at length, that he had occasion to change the instrument\n",
      "in his hand, for his shoemaker’s knife. It lay on that side of him\n",
      "which was not the side on which she stood. He had taken it up, and was\n",
      "stooping to work again, when his eyes caught the skirt of her dress. He\n",
      "raised them, and saw her face. The two spectators started forward,\n",
      "but she stayed them with a motion of her hand. She had no fear of his\n",
      "striking at her with the knife, though they had.\n",
      "\n",
      "He stared at her with a fearful look, and after a while his lips began\n",
      "to form some words, though no sound proceeded from them. By degrees, in\n",
      "the pauses of his quick and laboured breathing, he was heard to say:\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is this?”\n",
      "\n",
      "With the tears streaming down her face, she put her two hands to her\n",
      "lips, and kissed them to him; then clasped them on her breast, as if she\n",
      "laid his ruined head there.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are not the gaoler’s daughter?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She sighed “No.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who are you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Not yet trusting the tones of her voice, she sat down on the bench\n",
      "beside him. He recoiled, but she laid her hand upon his arm. A strange\n",
      "thrill struck him when she did so, and visibly passed over his frame; he\n",
      "laid the knife down softly, as he sat staring at her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her golden hair, which she wore in long curls, had been hurriedly pushed\n",
      "aside, and fell down over her neck. Advancing his hand by little and\n",
      "little, he took it up and looked at it. In the midst of the action\n",
      "he went astray, and, with another deep sigh, fell to work at his\n",
      "shoemaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "But not for long. Releasing his arm, she laid her hand upon his\n",
      "shoulder. After looking doubtfully at it, two or three times, as if to\n",
      "be sure that it was really there, he laid down his work, put his hand\n",
      "to his neck, and took off a blackened string with a scrap of folded rag\n",
      "attached to it. He opened this, carefully, on his knee, and it contained\n",
      "a very little quantity of hair: not more than one or two long golden\n",
      "hairs, which he had, in some old day, wound off upon his finger.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took her hair into his hand again, and looked closely at it. “It is\n",
      "the same. How can it be! When was it! How was it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "As the concentrated expression returned to his forehead, he seemed to\n",
      "become conscious that it was in hers too. He turned her full to the\n",
      "light, and looked at her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She had laid her head upon my shoulder, that night when I was summoned\n",
      "out--she had a fear of my going, though I had none--and when I was\n",
      "brought to the North Tower they found these upon my sleeve. ‘You will\n",
      "leave me them? They can never help me to escape in the body, though they\n",
      "may in the spirit.’ Those were the words I said. I remember them very\n",
      "well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He formed this speech with his lips many times before he could utter it.\n",
      "But when he did find spoken words for it, they came to him coherently,\n",
      "though slowly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How was this?--_Was it you_?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Once more, the two spectators started, as he turned upon her with a\n",
      "frightful suddenness. But she sat perfectly still in his grasp, and only\n",
      "said, in a low voice, “I entreat you, good gentlemen, do not come near\n",
      "us, do not speak, do not move!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hark!” he exclaimed. “Whose voice was that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "His hands released her as he uttered this cry, and went up to his white\n",
      "hair, which they tore in a frenzy. It died out, as everything but his\n",
      "shoemaking did die out of him, and he refolded his little packet and\n",
      "tried to secure it in his breast; but he still looked at her, and\n",
      "gloomily shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no, no; you are too young, too blooming. It can’t be. See what the\n",
      "prisoner is. These are not the hands she knew, this is not the face\n",
      "she knew, this is not a voice she ever heard. No, no. She was--and He\n",
      "was--before the slow years of the North Tower--ages ago. What is your\n",
      "name, my gentle angel?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hailing his softened tone and manner, his daughter fell upon her knees\n",
      "before him, with her appealing hands upon his breast.\n",
      "\n",
      "“O, sir, at another time you shall know my name, and who my mother was,\n",
      "and who my father, and how I never knew their hard, hard history. But I\n",
      "cannot tell you at this time, and I cannot tell you here. All that I may\n",
      "tell you, here and now, is, that I pray to you to touch me and to bless\n",
      "me. Kiss me, kiss me! O my dear, my dear!”\n",
      "\n",
      "His cold white head mingled with her radiant hair, which warmed and\n",
      "lighted it as though it were the light of Freedom shining on him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you hear in my voice--I don’t know that it is so, but I hope it\n",
      "is--if you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was\n",
      "sweet music in your ears, weep for it, weep for it! If you touch, in\n",
      "touching my hair, anything that recalls a beloved head that lay on your\n",
      "breast when you were young and free, weep for it, weep for it! If, when\n",
      "I hint to you of a Home that is before us, where I will be true to you\n",
      "with all my duty and with all my faithful service, I bring back the\n",
      "remembrance of a Home long desolate, while your poor heart pined away,\n",
      "weep for it, weep for it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She held him closer round the neck, and rocked him on her breast like a\n",
      "child.\n",

      "year one thousand seven hundred and eighty. It was very small, very\n",
      "dark, very ugly, very incommodious. It was an old-fashioned place,\n",
      "moreover, in the moral attribute that the partners in the House were\n",
      "proud of its smallness, proud of its darkness, proud of its ugliness,\n",
      "proud of its incommodiousness. They were even boastful of its eminence\n",
      "in those particulars, and were fired by an express conviction that, if\n",
      "it were less objectionable, it would be less respectable. This was\n",
      "no passive belief, but an active weapon which they flashed at more\n",
      "convenient places of business. Tellson’s (they said) wanted\n",
      "no elbow-room, Tellson’s wanted no light, Tellson’s wanted no\n",
      "embellishment. Noakes and Co.’s might, or Snooks Brothers’ might; but\n",
      "Tellson’s, thank Heaven--!\n",
      "\n",
      "Any one of these partners would have disinherited his son on the\n",
      "question of rebuilding Tellson’s. In this respect the House was much\n",
      "on a par with the Country; which did very often disinherit its sons for\n",
      "suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly\n",
      "objectionable, but were only the more respectable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus it had come to pass, that Tellson’s was the triumphant perfection\n",
      "of inconvenience. After bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacy with\n",
      "a weak rattle in its throat, you fell into Tellson’s down two steps,\n",
      "and came to your senses in a miserable little shop, with two little\n",
      "counters, where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the\n",
      "wind rustled it, while they examined the signature by the dingiest of\n",
      "windows, which were always under a shower-bath of mud from Fleet-street,\n",
      "and which were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper, and the\n",
      "heavy shadow of Temple Bar. If your business necessitated your seeing\n",
      "“the House,” you were put into a species of Condemned Hold at the back,\n",
      "where you meditated on a misspent life, until the House came with its\n",
      "hands in its pockets, and you could hardly blink at it in the dismal\n",
      "twilight. Your money came out of, or went into, wormy old wooden\n",
      "drawers, particles of which flew up your nose and down your throat when\n",
      "they were opened and shut. Your bank-notes had a musty odour, as if they\n",
      "were fast decomposing into rags again. Your plate was stowed away among\n",
      "the neighbouring cesspools, and evil communications corrupted its good\n",
      "polish in a day or two. Your deeds got into extemporised strong-rooms\n",
      "made of kitchens and sculleries, and fretted all the fat out of their\n",
      "parchments into the banking-house air. Your lighter boxes of family\n",
      "papers went up-stairs into a Barmecide room, that always had a great\n",
      "dining-table in it and never had a dinner, and where, even in the year\n",
      "one thousand seven hundred and eighty, the first letters written to you\n",
      "by your old love, or by your little children, were but newly released\n",
      "from the horror of being ogled through the windows, by the heads\n",
      "exposed on Temple Bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of\n",
      "Abyssinia or Ashantee.\n",
      "\n",
      "But indeed, at that time, putting to death was a recipe much in vogue\n",
      "with all trades and professions, and not least of all with Tellson’s.\n",
      "Death is Nature’s remedy for all things, and why not Legislation’s?\n",
      "Accordingly, the forger was put to Death; the utterer of a bad note\n",
      "was put to Death; the unlawful opener of a letter was put to Death; the\n",
      "purloiner of forty shillings and sixpence was put to Death; the holder\n",
      "of a horse at Tellson’s door, who made off with it, was put to\n",
      "Death; the coiner of a bad shilling was put to Death; the sounders of\n",
      "three-fourths of the notes in the whole gamut of Crime, were put to\n",
      "Death. Not that it did the least good in the way of prevention--it\n",
      "might almost have been worth remarking that the fact was exactly the\n",
      "reverse--but, it cleared off (as to this world) the trouble of each\n",
      "particular case, and left nothing else connected with it to be looked\n",
      "after. Thus, Tellson’s, in its day, like greater places of business,\n",
      "its contemporaries, had taken so many lives, that, if the heads laid\n",
      "low before it had been ranged on Temple Bar instead of being privately\n",

      "be seen, spectacularly poring over large books, and casting his breeches\n",
      "and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside Tellson’s--never by any means in it, unless called in--was an\n",
      "odd-job-man, an occasional porter and messenger, who served as the live\n",
      "sign of the house. He was never absent during business hours, unless\n",
      "upon an errand, and then he was represented by his son: a grisly urchin\n",
      "of twelve, who was his express image. People understood that Tellson’s,\n",
      "in a stately way, tolerated the odd-job-man. The house had always\n",
      "tolerated some person in that capacity, and time and tide had drifted\n",
      "this person to the post. His surname was Cruncher, and on the youthful\n",

      "already scrubbed throughout; and between the cups and saucers arranged\n",
      "for breakfast, and the lumbering deal table, a very clean white cloth\n",
      "was spread.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher reposed under a patchwork counterpane, like a Harlequin\n",

      "whereas he often came home after banking hours with clean boots, he\n",

      "\n",
      "Master Cruncher (who was in his shirt) took this very ill, and, turning\n",

      "inflict bodily and mental injuries of an acute description on passing\n",

      "“You know the Old Bailey well, no doubt?” said one of the oldest of\n",

      "\n",
      "“Ye-es, sir,” returned Jerry, in something of a dogged manner. “I _do_\n",
      "know the Bailey.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just so. And you know Mr. Lorry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know Mr. Lorry, sir, much better than I know the Bailey. Much\n",
      "better,” said Jerry, not unlike a reluctant witness at the establishment\n",
      "in question, “than I, as a honest tradesman, wish to know the Bailey.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very well. Find the door where the witnesses go in, and show the\n",
      "door-keeper this note for Mr. Lorry. He will then let you in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Into the court, sir?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Into the court.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher’s eyes seemed to get a little closer to one another, and to\n",
      "interchange the inquiry, “What do you think of this?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Am I to wait in the court, sir?” he asked, as the result of that\n",
      "conference.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am going to tell you. The door-keeper will pass the note to Mr.\n",
      "Lorry, and do you make any gesture that will attract Mr. Lorry’s\n",
      "attention, and show him where you stand. Then what you have to do, is,\n",
      "to remain there until he wants you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is that all, sir?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s all. He wishes to have a messenger at hand. This is to tell him\n",
      "you are there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As the ancient clerk deliberately folded and superscribed the note,\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher, after surveying him in silence until he came to the\n",
      "blotting-paper stage, remarked:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I suppose they’ll be trying Forgeries this morning?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Treason!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s quartering,” said Jerry. “Barbarous!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is the law,” remarked the ancient clerk, turning his surprised\n",
      "spectacles upon him. “It is the law.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s hard in the law to spile a man, I think. It’s hard enough to kill\n",
      "him, but it’s wery hard to spile him, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not at all,” retained the ancient clerk. “Speak well of the law. Take\n",
      "care of your chest and voice, my good friend, and leave the law to take\n",
      "care of itself. I give you that advice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s the damp, sir, what settles on my chest and voice,” said Jerry. “I\n",
      "leave you to judge what a damp way of earning a living mine is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, well,” said the old clerk; “we all have our various ways of\n",
      "gaining a livelihood. Some of us have damp ways, and some of us have dry\n",
      "ways. Here is the letter. Go along.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jerry took the letter, and, remarking to himself with less internal\n",
      "deference than he made an outward show of, “You are a lean old one,\n",
      "too,” made his bow, informed his son, in passing, of his destination,\n",
      "and went his way.\n",
      "\n",
      "They hanged at Tyburn, in those days, so the street outside Newgate had\n",
      "not obtained one infamous notoriety that has since attached to it.\n",
      "But, the gaol was a vile place, in which most kinds of debauchery and\n",
      "villainy were practised, and where dire diseases were bred, that came\n",
      "into court with the prisoners, and sometimes rushed straight from the\n",
      "dock at my Lord Chief Justice himself, and pulled him off the bench. It\n",
      "had more than once happened, that the Judge in the black cap pronounced\n",
      "his own doom as certainly as the prisoner’s, and even died before him.\n",
      "For the rest, the Old Bailey was famous as a kind of deadly inn-yard,\n",
      "from which pale travellers set out continually, in carts and coaches, on\n",
      "a violent passage into the other world: traversing some two miles and a\n",
      "half of public street and road, and shaming few good citizens, if any.\n",
      "So powerful is use, and so desirable to be good use in the beginning. It\n",
      "was famous, too, for the pillory, a wise old institution, that inflicted\n",
      "a punishment of which no one could foresee the extent; also, for\n",
      "the whipping-post, another dear old institution, very humanising and\n",
      "softening to behold in action; also, for extensive transactions in\n",
      "blood-money, another fragment of ancestral wisdom, systematically\n",
      "leading to the most frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed\n",
      "under Heaven. Altogether, the Old Bailey, at that date, was a choice\n",
      "illustration of the precept, that “Whatever is is right;” an aphorism\n",
      "that would be as final as it is lazy, did it not include the troublesome\n",
      "consequence, that nothing that ever was, was wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "Making his way through the tainted crowd, dispersed up and down this\n",
      "hideous scene of action, with the skill of a man accustomed to make his\n",
      "way quietly, the messenger found out the door he sought, and handed in\n",
      "his letter through a trap in it. For, people then paid to see the play\n",
      "at the Old Bailey, just as they paid to see the play in Bedlam--only the\n",
      "former entertainment was much the dearer. Therefore, all the Old Bailey\n",
      "doors were well guarded--except, indeed, the social doors by which the\n",
      "criminals got there, and those were always left wide open.\n",
      "\n",
      "After some delay and demur, the door grudgingly turned on its hinges a\n",
      "very little way, and allowed Mr. Jerry Cruncher to squeeze himself into\n",
      "court.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What’s on?” he asked, in a whisper, of the man he found himself next\n",
      "to.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What’s coming on?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Treason case.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The quartering one, eh?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah!” returned the man, with a relish; “he’ll be drawn on a hurdle to\n",
      "be half hanged, and then he’ll be taken down and sliced before his own\n",
      "face, and then his inside will be taken out and burnt while he looks on,\n",
      "and then his head will be chopped off, and he’ll be cut into quarters.\n",
      "That’s the sentence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If he’s found Guilty, you mean to say?” Jerry added, by way of proviso.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! they’ll find him guilty,” said the other. “Don’t you be afraid of\n",
      "that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher’s attention was here diverted to the door-keeper, whom he\n",
      "saw making his way to Mr. Lorry, with the note in his hand. Mr. Lorry\n",
      "sat at a table, among the gentlemen in wigs: not far from a wigged\n",
      "gentleman, the prisoner’s counsel, who had a great bundle of papers\n",
      "before him: and nearly opposite another wigged gentleman with his hands\n",
      "in his pockets, whose whole attention, when Mr. Cruncher looked at him\n",
      "then or afterwards, seemed to be concentrated on the ceiling of the\n",
      "court. After some gruff coughing and rubbing of his chin and signing\n",
      "with his hand, Jerry attracted the notice of Mr. Lorry, who had stood up\n",
      "to look for him, and who quietly nodded and sat down again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What’s _he_ got to do with the case?” asked the man he had spoken with.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Blest if I know,” said Jerry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What have _you_ got to do with it, then, if a person may inquire?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Blest if I know that either,” said Jerry.\n",
      "\n",
      "The entrance of the Judge, and a consequent great stir and settling\n",
      "down in the court, stopped the dialogue. Presently, the dock became the\n",
      "central point of interest. Two gaolers, who had been standing there,\n",
      "went out, and the prisoner was brought in, and put to the bar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody present, except the one wigged gentleman who looked at the\n",
      "ceiling, stared at him. All the human breath in the place, rolled\n",
      "at him, like a sea, or a wind, or a fire. Eager faces strained round\n",
      "pillars and corners, to get a sight of him; spectators in back rows\n",
      "stood up, not to miss a hair of him; people on the floor of the court,\n",
      "laid their hands on the shoulders of the people before them, to help\n",
      "themselves, at anybody’s cost, to a view of him--stood a-tiptoe, got\n",
      "upon ledges, stood upon next to nothing, to see every inch of him.\n",
      "Conspicuous among these latter, like an animated bit of the spiked wall\n",
      "of Newgate, Jerry stood: aiming at the prisoner the beery breath of a\n",
      "whet he had taken as he came along, and discharging it to mingle with\n",
      "the waves of other beer, and gin, and tea, and coffee, and what not,\n",
      "that flowed at him, and already broke upon the great windows behind him\n",
      "in an impure mist and rain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The object of all this staring and blaring, was a young man of about\n",
      "five-and-twenty, well-grown and well-looking, with a sunburnt cheek and\n",
      "a dark eye. His condition was that of a young gentleman. He was plainly\n",
      "dressed in black, or very dark grey, and his hair, which was long and\n",
      "dark, was gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neck; more to be out\n",
      "of his way than for ornament. As an emotion of the mind will express\n",
      "itself through any covering of the body, so the paleness which his\n",
      "situation engendered came through the brown upon his cheek, showing the\n",
      "soul to be stronger than the sun. He was otherwise quite self-possessed,\n",
      "bowed to the Judge, and stood quiet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sort of interest with which this man was stared and breathed at,\n",
      "was not a sort that elevated humanity. Had he stood in peril of a less\n",
      "horrible sentence--had there been a chance of any one of its savage\n",
      "details being spared--by just so much would he have lost in his\n",
      "fascination. The form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully mangled,\n",
      "was the sight; the immortal creature that was to be so butchered\n",
      "and torn asunder, yielded the sensation. Whatever gloss the various\n",
      "spectators put upon the interest, according to their several arts and\n",
      "powers of self-deceit, the interest was, at the root of it, Ogreish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Silence in the court! Charles Darnay had yesterday pleaded Not Guilty to\n",
      "an indictment denouncing him (with infinite jingle and jangle) for that\n",
      "he was a false traitor to our serene, illustrious, excellent, and so\n",
      "forth, prince, our Lord the King, by reason of his having, on divers\n",
      "occasions, and by divers means and ways, assisted Lewis, the French\n",
      "King, in his wars against our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and\n",
      "so forth; that was to say, by coming and going, between the dominions of\n",
      "our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, and those of the\n",
      "said French Lewis, and wickedly, falsely, traitorously, and otherwise\n",
      "evil-adverbiously, revealing to the said French Lewis what forces our\n",

      "to send to Canada and North America. This much, Jerry, with his head\n",
      "becoming more and more spiky as the law terms bristled it, made out with\n",
      "huge satisfaction, and so arrived circuitously at the understanding that\n",
      "the aforesaid, and over and over again aforesaid, Charles Darnay, stood\n",
      "there before him upon his trial; that the jury were swearing in; and\n",

      "beheaded, and quartered, by everybody there, neither flinched from\n",
      "the situation, nor assumed any theatrical air in it. He was quiet and\n",
      "attentive; watched the opening proceedings with a grave interest;\n",
      "and stood with his hands resting on the slab of wood before him, so\n",
      "composedly, that they had not displaced a leaf of the herbs with which\n",
      "it was strewn. The court was all bestrewn with herbs and sprinkled with\n",
      "vinegar, as a precaution against gaol air and gaol fever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the prisoner’s head there was a mirror, to throw the light down\n",
      "upon him. Crowds of the wicked and the wretched had been reflected in\n",
      "it, and had passed from its surface and this earth’s together. Haunted\n",
      "in a most ghastly manner that abominable place would have been, if the\n",
      "glass could ever have rendered back its reflections, as the ocean is one\n",
      "day to give up its dead. Some passing thought of the infamy and disgrace\n",
      "for which it had been reserved, may have struck the prisoner’s mind. Be\n",
      "that as it may, a change in his position making him conscious of a bar\n",
      "of light across his face, he looked up; and when he saw the glass his\n",
      "face flushed, and his right hand pushed the herbs away.\n",
      "\n",
      "It happened, that the action turned his face to that side of the court\n",
      "which was on his left. About on a level with his eyes, there sat,\n",
      "in that corner of the Judge’s bench, two persons upon whom his look\n",
      "immediately rested; so immediately, and so much to the changing of his\n",
      "aspect, that all the eyes that were turned upon him, turned to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The spectators saw in the two figures, a young lady of little more than\n",
      "twenty, and a gentleman who was evidently her father; a man of a very\n",
      "remarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness of his hair,\n",
      "and a certain indescribable intensity of face: not of an active kind,\n",
      "but pondering and self-communing. When this expression was upon him, he\n",
      "looked as if he were old; but when it was stirred and broken up--as\n",
      "it was now, in a moment, on his speaking to his daughter--he became a\n",
      "handsome man, not past the prime of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "His daughter had one of her hands drawn through his arm, as she sat by\n",
      "him, and the other pressed upon it. She had drawn close to him, in her\n",
      "dread of the scene, and in her pity for the prisoner. Her forehead had\n",
      "been strikingly expressive of an engrossing terror and compassion\n",
      "that saw nothing but the peril of the accused. This had been so very\n",
      "noticeable, so very powerfully and naturally shown, that starers who\n",

      "public enemy was not a correspondence of to-day, or of yesterday, or\n",
      "even of last year, or of the year before. That, it was certain the\n",
      "prisoner had, for longer than that, been in the habit of passing and\n",

      "of clothes; showing them how the patriot, Barsad, was a hired spy and\n",
      "traitor, an unblushing trafficker in blood, and one of the greatest\n",
      "scoundrels upon earth since accursed Judas--which he certainly did look\n",
      "rather like. How the virtuous servant, Cly, was his friend and partner,\n",
      "and was worthy to be; how the watchful eyes of those forgers and false\n",
      "swearers had rested on the prisoner as a victim, because some family\n",
      "affairs in France, he being of French extraction, did require his making\n",
      "those passages across the Channel--though what those affairs were, a\n",
      "consideration for others who were near and dear to him, forbade him,\n",
      "even for his life, to disclose. How the evidence that had been warped\n",
      "and wrested from the young lady, whose anguish in giving it they\n",
      "had witnessed, came to nothing, involving the mere little innocent\n",
      "gallantries and politenesses likely to pass between any young gentleman\n",
      "and young lady so thrown together;--with the exception of that\n",
      "reference to George Washington, which was altogether too extravagant and\n",
      "impossible to be regarded in any other light than as a monstrous joke.\n",
      "How it would be a weakness in the government to break down in this\n",
      "attempt to practise for popularity on the lowest national antipathies\n",
      "and fears, and therefore Mr. Attorney-General had made the most of it;\n",
      "how, nevertheless, it rested upon nothing, save that vile and infamous\n",
      "character of evidence too often disfiguring such cases, and of which the\n",
      "State Trials of this country were full. But, there my Lord interposed\n",
      "(with as grave a face as if it had not been true), saying that he could\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. Stryver then called his few witnesses, and Mr. Cruncher had next to\n",

      "Stryver had fitted on the jury, inside out; showing how Barsad and\n",
      "Cly were even a hundred times better than he had thought them, and the\n",
      "prisoner a hundred times worse. Lastly, came my Lord himself, turning\n",
      "the suit of clothes, now inside out, now outside in, but on the whole\n",
      "decidedly trimming and shaping them into grave-clothes for the prisoner.\n",

      "whispered with those who sat near, and from time to time glanced\n",
      "anxiously at the jury; while all the spectators moved more or less, and\n",
      "grouped themselves anew; while even my Lord himself arose from his seat,\n",
      "and slowly paced up and down his platform, not unattended by a suspicion\n",
      "in the minds of the audience that his state was feverish; this one man\n",
      "sat leaning back, with his torn gown half off him, his untidy wig put\n",
      "on just as it had happened to light on his head after its removal, his\n",
      "hands in his pockets, and his eyes on the ceiling as they had been all\n",
      "day. Something especially reckless in his demeanour, not only gave him\n",
      "a disreputable look, but so diminished the strong resemblance he\n",
      "undoubtedly bore to the prisoner (which his momentary earnestness,\n",
      "when they were compared together, had strengthened), that many of the\n",
      "lookers-on, taking note of him now, said to one another they would\n",
      "hardly have thought the two were so alike. Mr. Cruncher made the\n",
      "observation to his next neighbour, and added, “I’d hold half a guinea\n",

      "her father’s breast, he was the first to see it, and to say audibly:\n",
      "“Officer! look to that young lady. Help the gentleman to take her out.\n",

      "\n",
      "There was much commiseration for her as she was removed, and much\n",

      "him, to have the days of his imprisonment recalled. He had shown\n",
      "strong internal agitation when he was questioned, and that pondering or\n",
      "brooding look which made him old, had been upon him, like a heavy cloud,\n",
      "ever since. As he passed out, the jury, who had turned back and paused a\n",
      "moment, spoke, through their foreman.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were not agreed, and wished to retire. My Lord (perhaps with George\n",
      "Washington on his mind) showed some surprise that they were not agreed,\n",
      "but signified his pleasure that they should retire under watch and ward,\n",
      "and retired himself. The trial had lasted all day, and the lamps in\n",
      "the court were now being lighted. It began to be rumoured that the\n",

      "way. You will be sure to hear when the jury come in. Don’t be a moment\n",
      "behind them, for I want you to take the verdict back to the bank. You\n",
      "are the quickest messenger I know, and will get to Temple Bar long\n",
      "before I can.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jerry had just enough forehead to knuckle, and he knuckled it in\n",
      "acknowledgment of this communication and a shilling. Mr. Carton came up\n",
      "at the moment, and touched Mr. Lorry on the arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How is the young lady?”\n",
      "\n",

      "will do very well. You have seen the worst of her agitation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am deeply sorry to have been the cause of it. Could you tell her so\n",
      "for me, with my fervent acknowledgments?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I could. I will, if you ask it.”\n",
      "\n",

      "“I do ask it. Accept my cordial thanks.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What,” said Carton, still only half turned towards him, “do you expect,\n",

      "\n",
      "“The worst.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s the wisest thing to expect, and the likeliest. But I think their\n",

      "Loitering on the way out of court not being allowed, Jerry heard no\n",
      "more: but left them--so like each other in feature, so unlike each other\n",

      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "An hour and a half limped heavily away in the thief-and-rascal crowded\n",
      "passages below, even though assisted off with mutton pies and ale.\n",
      "The hoarse messenger, uncomfortably seated on a form after taking that\n",
      "refection, had dropped into a doze, when a loud murmur and a rapid tide\n",
      "of people setting up the stairs that led to the court, carried him along\n",
      "with them.\n",
      "\n",

      "until he was clear of the Old Bailey; for, the crowd came pouring out\n",
      "with a vehemence that nearly took him off his legs, and a loud buzz\n",

      "\n",
      "From the dimly-lighted passages of the court, the last sediment of the\n",
      "human stew that had been boiling there all day, was straining off, when\n",
      "Doctor Manette, Lucie Manette, his daughter, Mr. Lorry, the solicitor\n",
      "for the defence, and its counsel, Mr. Stryver, stood gathered round Mr.\n",
      "Charles Darnay--just released--congratulating him on his escape from\n",
      "death.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would have been difficult by a far brighter light, to recognise\n",
      "in Doctor Manette, intellectual of face and upright of bearing, the\n",
      "shoemaker of the garret in Paris. Yet, no one could have looked at him\n",
      "twice, without looking again: even though the opportunity of observation\n",
      "had not extended to the mournful cadence of his low grave voice, and\n",
      "to the abstraction that overclouded him fitfully, without any apparent\n",
      "reason. While one external cause, and that a reference to his long\n",
      "lingering agony, would always--as on the trial--evoke this condition\n",
      "from the depths of his soul, it was also in its nature to arise of\n",
      "itself, and to draw a gloom over him, as incomprehensible to those\n",
      "unacquainted with his story as if they had seen the shadow of the actual\n",
      "Bastille thrown upon him by a summer sun, when the substance was three\n",
      "hundred miles away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only his daughter had the power of charming this black brooding from\n",
      "his mind. She was the golden thread that united him to a Past beyond his\n",
      "misery, and to a Present beyond his misery: and the sound of her voice,\n",
      "the light of her face, the touch of her hand, had a strong beneficial\n",
      "influence with him almost always. Not absolutely always, for she could\n",
      "recall some occasions on which her power had failed; but they were few\n",
      "and slight, and she believed them over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darnay had kissed her hand fervently and gratefully, and had turned\n",
      "to Mr. Stryver, whom he warmly thanked. Mr. Stryver, a man of little\n",
      "more than thirty, but looking twenty years older than he was, stout,\n",
      "loud, red, bluff, and free from any drawback of delicacy, had a pushing\n",
      "way of shouldering himself (morally and physically) into companies and\n",
      "conversations, that argued well for his shouldering his way up in life.\n",
      "\n",
      "He still had his wig and gown on, and he said, squaring himself at his\n",
      "late client to that degree that he squeezed the innocent Mr. Lorry clean\n",
      "out of the group: “I am glad to have brought you off with honour, Mr.\n",
      "Darnay. It was an infamous prosecution, grossly infamous; but not the\n",
      "less likely to succeed on that account.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have laid me under an obligation to you for life--in two senses,”\n",
      " said his late client, taking his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have done my best for you, Mr. Darnay; and my best is as good as\n",

      "\n",
      "It clearly being incumbent on some one to say, “Much better,” Mr. Lorry\n",
      "said it; perhaps not quite disinterestedly, but with the interested\n",
      "object of squeezing himself back again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You think so?” said Mr. Stryver. “Well! you have been present all day,\n",
      "and you ought to know. You are a man of business, too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And as such,” quoth Mr. Lorry, whom the counsel learned in the law had\n",
      "now shouldered back into the group, just as he had previously shouldered\n",
      "him out of it--“as such I will appeal to Doctor Manette, to break up\n",
      "this conference and order us all to our homes. Miss Lucie looks ill, Mr.\n",
      "Darnay has had a terrible day, we are worn out.”\n",
      "\n",

      "“I speak for myself,” answered Mr. Lorry, “and for Mr. Darnay, and for\n",
      "Miss Lucie, and--Miss Lucie, do you not think I may speak for us all?”\n",
      " He asked her the question pointedly, and with a glance at her father.\n",
      "\n",
      "His face had become frozen, as it were, in a very curious look at\n",
      "Darnay: an intent look, deepening into a frown of dislike and distrust,\n",
      "not even unmixed with fear. With this strange expression on him his\n",
      "thoughts had wandered away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My father,” said Lucie, softly laying her hand on his.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Shall we go home, my father?”\n",
      "\n",
      "With a long breath, he answered “Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed, under the\n",
      "impression--which he himself had originated--that he would not be\n",
      "released that night. The lights were nearly all extinguished in the\n",
      "passages, the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle,\n",
      "and the dismal place was deserted until to-morrow morning’s interest of\n",
      "gallows, pillory, whipping-post, and branding-iron, should repeople it.\n",
      "Walking between her father and Mr. Darnay, Lucie Manette passed into\n",
      "the open air. A hackney-coach was called, and the father and daughter\n",
      "departed in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Stryver had left them in the passages, to shoulder his way back\n",
      "to the robing-room. Another person, who had not joined the group, or\n",
      "interchanged a word with any one of them, but who had been leaning\n",
      "against the wall where its shadow was darkest, had silently strolled\n",
      "out after the rest, and had looked on until the coach drove away. He now\n",
      "stepped up to where Mr. Lorry and Mr. Darnay stood upon the pavement.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So, Mr. Lorry! Men of business may speak to Mr. Darnay now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody had made any acknowledgment of Mr. Carton’s part in the day’s\n",
      "proceedings; nobody had known of it. He was unrobed, and was none the\n",
      "better for it in appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you knew what a conflict goes on in the business mind, when the\n",
      "business mind is divided between good-natured impulse and business\n",
      "appearances, you would be amused, Mr. Darnay.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry reddened, and said, warmly, “You have mentioned that before,\n",
      "sir. We men of business, who serve a House, are not our own masters. We\n",
      "have to think of the House more than ourselves.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ know, _I_ know,” rejoined Mr. Carton, carelessly. “Don’t be\n",
      "nettled, Mr. Lorry. You are as good as another, I have no doubt: better,\n",
      "I dare say.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And indeed, sir,” pursued Mr. Lorry, not minding him, “I really don’t\n",
      "know what you have to do with the matter. If you’ll excuse me, as very\n",
      "much your elder, for saying so, I really don’t know that it is your\n",
      "business.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Business! Bless you, _I_ have no business,” said Mr. Carton.\n",
      "\n",

      "“Lord love you, no!--I shouldn’t,” said Mr. Carton.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, sir!” cried Mr. Lorry, thoroughly heated by his indifference,\n",
      "“business is a very good thing, and a very respectable thing. And, sir,\n",
      "if business imposes its restraints and its silences and impediments, Mr.\n",
      "Darnay as a young gentleman of generosity knows how to make allowance\n",
      "for that circumstance. Mr. Darnay, good night, God bless you, sir!\n",
      "I hope you have been this day preserved for a prosperous and happy\n",
      "life.--Chair there!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps a little angry with himself, as well as with the barrister, Mr.\n",
      "Lorry bustled into the chair, and was carried off to Tellson’s. Carton,\n",
      "who smelt of port wine, and did not appear to be quite sober, laughed\n",
      "then, and turned to Darnay:\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is a strange chance that throws you and me together. This must\n",

      "“I begin to think I _am_ faint.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then why the devil don’t you dine? I dined, myself, while those\n",

      "some other. Let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Drawing his arm through his own, he took him down Ludgate-hill to\n",
      "Fleet-street, and so, up a covered way, into a tavern. Here, they were\n",
      "shown into a little room, where Charles Darnay was soon recruiting\n",
      "his strength with a good plain dinner and good wine: while Carton sat\n",
      "opposite to him at the same table, with his separate bottle of port\n",
      "before him, and his fully half-insolent manner upon him.\n",

      "mended as to feel that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It must be an immense satisfaction!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He said it bitterly, and filled up his glass again: which was a large\n",
      "one.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As to me, the greatest desire I have, is to forget that I belong to it.\n",

      "or two. Steeping the towels in the water, and partially wringing them\n",
      "out, he folded them on his head in a manner hideous to behold, sat down\n",
      "at the table, and said, “Now I am ready!”\n",
      "\n",

      "proper, on the other side of it, with the bottles and glasses ready to\n",
      "his hand. Both resorted to the drinking-table without stint, but each in\n",
      "a different way; the lion for the most part reclining with his hands in\n",
      "his waistband, looking at the fire, or occasionally flirting with some\n",
      "lighter document; the jackal, with knitted brows and intent face,\n",
      "so deep in his task, that his eyes did not even follow the hand he\n",
      "stretched out for his glass--which often groped about, for a minute or\n",
      "more, before it found the glass for his lips. Two or three times, the\n",
      "matter in hand became so knotty, that the jackal found it imperative on\n",
      "him to get up, and steep his towels anew. From these pilgrimages to the\n",
      "jug and basin, he returned with such eccentricities of damp headgear as\n",
      "no words can describe; which were made the more ludicrous by his anxious\n",
      "gravity.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length the jackal had got together a compact repast for the lion, and\n",
      "proceeded to offer it to him. The lion took it with care and caution,\n",
      "made his selections from it, and his remarks upon it, and the jackal\n",
      "assisted both. When the repast was fully discussed, the lion put his\n",
      "hands in his waistband again, and lay down to meditate. The jackal then\n",
      "invigorated himself with a bumper for his throttle, and a fresh application\n",
      "to his head, and applied himself to the collection of a second meal;\n",
      "this was administered to the lion in the same manner, and was not\n",
      "disposed of until the clocks struck three in the morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And now we have done, Sydney, fill a bumper of punch,” said Mr.\n",
      "Stryver.\n",

      "again, shook himself, yawned, shivered, and complied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You were very sound, Sydney, in the matter of those crown witnesses\n",
      "to-day. Every question told.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I always am sound; am I not?”\n",
      "\n",

      "it and smooth it again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With a deprecatory grunt, the jackal again complied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The old Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School,” said Stryver, nodding\n",
      "his head over him as he reviewed him in the present and the past, “the\n",
      "old seesaw Sydney. Up one minute and down the next; now in spirits and\n",
      "now in despondency!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah!” returned the other, sighing: “yes! The same Sydney, with the same\n",
      "luck. Even then, I did exercises for other boys, and seldom did my own.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And why not?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“God knows. It was my way, I suppose.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat, with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched out before\n",
      "him, looking at the fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Carton,” said his friend, squaring himself at him with a bullying air,\n",
      "as if the fire-grate had been the furnace in which sustained endeavour\n",
      "was forged, and the one delicate thing to be done for the old Sydney\n",
      "Carton of old Shrewsbury School was to shoulder him into it, “your way\n",
      "is, and always was, a lame way. You summon no energy and purpose. Look\n",
      "at me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, botheration!” returned Sydney, with a lighter and more\n",
      "good-humoured laugh, “don’t _you_ be moral!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How have I done what I have done?” said Stryver; “how do I do what I\n",
      "do?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Partly through paying me to help you, I suppose. But it’s not worth\n",
      "your while to apostrophise me, or the air, about it; what you want to\n",
      "do, you do. You were always in the front rank, and I was always behind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I had to get into the front rank; I was not born there, was I?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was not present at the ceremony; but my opinion is you were,” said\n",
      "Carton. At this, he laughed again, and they both laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Before Shrewsbury, and at Shrewsbury, and ever since Shrewsbury,”\n",
      " pursued Carton, “you have fallen into your rank, and I have fallen into\n",
      "mine. Even when we were fellow-students in the Student-Quarter of Paris,\n",
      "picking up French, and French law, and other French crumbs that we\n",
      "didn’t get much good of, you were always somewhere, and I was always\n",
      "nowhere.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And whose fault was that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Upon my soul, I am not sure that it was not yours. You were always\n",
      "driving and riving and shouldering and passing, to that restless degree\n",
      "that I had no chance for my life but in rust and repose. It’s a gloomy\n",
      "thing, however, to talk about one’s own past, with the day breaking.\n",
      "Turn me in some other direction before I go.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well then! Pledge me to the pretty witness,” said Stryver, holding up\n",
      "his glass. “Are you turned in a pleasant direction?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Apparently not, for he became gloomy again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pretty witness,” he muttered, looking down into his glass. “I have had\n",
      "enough of witnesses to-day and to-night; who’s your pretty witness?”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Rot the admiration of the whole Court! Who made the Old Bailey a judge\n",
      "of beauty? She was a golden-haired doll!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you know, Sydney,” said Mr. Stryver, looking at him with sharp eyes,\n",
      "and slowly drawing a hand across his florid face: “do you know, I rather\n",
      "thought, at the time, that you sympathised with the golden-haired doll,\n",
      "and were quick to see what happened to the golden-haired doll?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quick to see what happened! If a girl, doll or no doll, swoons within a\n",
      "yard or two of a man’s nose, he can see it without a perspective-glass.\n",

      "When his host followed him out on the staircase with a candle, to light\n",
      "him down the stairs, the day was coldly looking in through its grimy\n",
      "windows. When he got out of the house, the air was cold and sad, the\n",
      "dull sky overcast, the river dark and dim, the whole scene like a\n",
      "lifeless desert. And wreaths of dust were spinning round and round\n",
      "before the morning blast, as if the desert-sand had risen far away, and\n",
      "the first spray of it in its advance had begun to overwhelm the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "Waste forces within him, and a desert all around, this man stood still\n",
      "on his way across a silent terrace, and saw for a moment, lying in the\n",
      "wilderness before him, a mirage of honourable ambition, self-denial, and\n",
      "perseverance. In the fair city of this vision, there were airy galleries\n",
      "from which the loves and graces looked upon him, gardens in which the\n",
      "fruits of life hung ripening, waters of Hope that sparkled in his sight.\n",
      "A moment, and it was gone. Climbing to a high chamber in a well of\n",
      "houses, he threw himself down in his clothes on a neglected bed, and its\n",
      "pillow was wet with wasted tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sadly, sadly, the sun rose; it rose upon no sadder sight than the man of\n",

      "\n",
      "On this certain fine Sunday, Mr. Lorry walked towards Soho, early in\n",

      "A quainter corner than the corner where the Doctor lived, was not to be\n",

      "the Doctor’s lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of street that\n",
      "had a congenial air of retirement on it. There were few buildings then,\n",
      "north of the Oxford-road, and forest-trees flourished, and wild flowers\n",
      "grew, and the hawthorn blossomed, in the now vanished fields. As a\n",
      "consequence, country airs circulated in Soho with vigorous freedom,\n",
      "instead of languishing into the parish like stray paupers without a\n",

      "audible any day, and which was shunned by all of them at night. In\n",
      "a building at the back, attainable by a courtyard where a plane-tree\n",
      "rustled its green leaves, church-organs claimed to be made, and silver\n",
      "to be chased, and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant\n",
      "who had a golden arm starting out of the wall of the front hall--as if\n",
      "he had beaten himself precious, and menaced a similar conversion of all\n",
      "visitors. Very little of these trades, or of a lonely lodger rumoured\n",
      "to live up-stairs, or of a dim coach-trimming maker asserted to have\n",
      "a counting-house below, was ever heard or seen. Occasionally, a stray\n",
      "workman putting his coat on, traversed the hall, or a stranger peered\n",
      "about there, or a distant clink was heard across the courtyard, or a\n",
      "thump from the golden giant. These, however, were only the exceptions\n",
      "required to prove the rule that the sparrows in the plane-tree behind\n",
      "the house, and the echoes in the corner before it, had their own way\n",
      "from Sunday morning unto Saturday night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctor Manette received such patients here as his old reputation, and\n",
      "its revival in the floating whispers of his story, brought him.\n",
      "His scientific knowledge, and his vigilance and skill in conducting\n",
      "ingenious experiments, brought him otherwise into moderate request, and\n",
      "he earned as much as he wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "These things were within Mr. Jarvis Lorry’s knowledge, thoughts, and\n",
      "notice, when he rang the door-bell of the tranquil house in the corner,\n",
      "on the fine Sunday afternoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Doctor Manette at home?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Expected home.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Lucie at home?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Expected home.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Pross at home?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Possibly at home, but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to\n",
      "anticipate intentions of Miss Pross, as to admission or denial of the\n",
      "fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As I am at home myself,” said Mr. Lorry, “I’ll go upstairs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the Doctor’s daughter had known nothing of the country of her\n",
      "birth, she appeared to have innately derived from it that ability to\n",
      "make much of little means, which is one of its most useful and most\n",
      "agreeable characteristics. Simple as the furniture was, it was set off\n",
      "by so many little adornments, of no value but for their taste and fancy,\n",
      "that its effect was delightful. The disposition of everything in the\n",
      "rooms, from the largest object to the least; the arrangement of colours,\n",
      "the elegant variety and contrast obtained by thrift in trifles, by\n",
      "delicate hands, clear eyes, and good sense; were at once so pleasant in\n",
      "themselves, and so expressive of their originator, that, as Mr. Lorry\n",
      "stood looking about him, the very chairs and tables seemed to ask him,\n",
      "with something of that peculiar expression which he knew so well by this\n",
      "time, whether he approved?\n",
      "\n",
      "There were three rooms on a floor, and, the doors by which they\n",
      "communicated being put open that the air might pass freely through them\n",
      "all, Mr. Lorry, smilingly observant of that fanciful resemblance which\n",
      "he detected all around him, walked from one to another. The first was\n",
      "the best room, and in it were Lucie’s birds, and flowers, and books,\n",
      "and desk, and work-table, and box of water-colours; the second was\n",
      "the Doctor’s consulting-room, used also as the dining-room; the third,\n",
      "changingly speckled by the rustle of the plane-tree in the yard, was the\n",
      "Doctor’s bedroom, and there, in a corner, stood the disused shoemaker’s\n",
      "bench and tray of tools, much as it had stood on the fifth floor of the\n",
      "dismal house by the wine-shop, in the suburb of Saint Antoine in Paris.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wonder,” said Mr. Lorry, pausing in his looking about, “that he keeps\n",
      "that reminder of his sufferings about him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And why wonder at that?” was the abrupt inquiry that made him start.\n",
      "\n",
      "It proceeded from Miss Pross, the wild red woman, strong of hand, whose\n",
      "acquaintance he had first made at the Royal George Hotel at Dover, and\n",
      "had since improved.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should have thought--” Mr. Lorry began.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pooh! You’d have thought!” said Miss Pross; and Mr. Lorry left off.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How do you do?” inquired that lady then--sharply, and yet as if to\n",
      "express that she bore him no malice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am pretty well, I thank you,” answered Mr. Lorry, with meekness; “how\n",
      "are you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing to boast of,” said Miss Pross.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! indeed!” said Miss Pross. “I am very much put out about my\n",
      "Ladybird.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For gracious sake say something else besides ‘indeed,’ or you’ll\n",
      "fidget me to death,” said Miss Pross: whose character (dissociated from\n",
      "stature) was shortness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Really, then?” said Mr. Lorry, as an amendment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Really, is bad enough,” returned Miss Pross, “but better. Yes, I am\n",
      "very much put out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“May I ask the cause?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of Ladybird, to\n",
      "come here looking after her,” said Miss Pross.\n",
      "\n",
      "“_Do_ dozens come for that purpose?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hundreds,” said Miss Pross.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was characteristic of this lady (as of some other people before her\n",
      "time and since) that whenever her original proposition was questioned,\n",
      "she exaggerated it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear me!” said Mr. Lorry, as the safest remark he could think of.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have lived with the darling--or the darling has lived with me, and\n",
      "paid me for it; which she certainly should never have done, you may take\n",
      "your affidavit, if I could have afforded to keep either myself or her\n",
      "for nothing--since she was ten years old. And it’s really very hard,”\n",
      " said Miss Pross.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not seeing with precision what was very hard, Mr. Lorry shook his head;\n",
      "using that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloak that would\n",
      "fit anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the pet,\n",
      "are always turning up,” said Miss Pross. “When you began it--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ began it, Miss Pross?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Didn’t you? Who brought her father to life?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! If _that_ was beginning it--” said Mr. Lorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It wasn’t ending it, I suppose? I say, when you began it, it was hard\n",
      "enough; not that I have any fault to find with Doctor Manette, except\n",
      "that he is not worthy of such a daughter, which is no imputation on\n",
      "him, for it was not to be expected that anybody should be, under any\n",
      "circumstances. But it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds\n",
      "and multitudes of people turning up after him (I could have forgiven\n",
      "him), to take Ladybird’s affections away from me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry knew Miss Pross to be very jealous, but he also knew her by\n",
      "this time to be, beneath the service of her eccentricity, one of those\n",
      "unselfish creatures--found only among women--who will, for pure love and\n",
      "admiration, bind themselves willing slaves, to youth when they have lost\n",
      "it, to beauty that they never had, to accomplishments that they were\n",
      "never fortunate enough to gain, to bright hopes that never shone upon\n",
      "their own sombre lives. He knew enough of the world to know that there\n",
      "is nothing in it better than the faithful service of the heart; so\n",
      "rendered and so free from any mercenary taint, he had such an exalted\n",
      "respect for it, that in the retributive arrangements made by his own\n",
      "mind--we all make such arrangements, more or less--he stationed Miss\n",
      "Pross much nearer to the lower Angels than many ladies immeasurably\n",
      "better got up both by Nature and Art, who had balances at Tellson’s.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There never was, nor will be, but one man worthy of Ladybird,” said\n",
      "Miss Pross; “and that was my brother Solomon, if he hadn’t made a\n",
      "mistake in life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here again: Mr. Lorry’s inquiries into Miss Pross’s personal history had\n",
      "established the fact that her brother Solomon was a heartless scoundrel\n",
      "who had stripped her of everything she possessed, as a stake to\n",
      "speculate with, and had abandoned her in her poverty for evermore, with\n",
      "no touch of compunction. Miss Pross’s fidelity of belief in Solomon\n",
      "(deducting a mere trifle for this slight mistake) was quite a serious\n",
      "matter with Mr. Lorry, and had its weight in his good opinion of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As we happen to be alone for the moment, and are both people of\n",
      "business,” he said, when they had got back to the drawing-room and had\n",
      "sat down there in friendly relations, “let me ask you--does the Doctor,\n",
      "in talking with Lucie, never refer to the shoemaking time, yet?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah!” returned Miss Pross, shaking her head. “But I don’t say he don’t\n",
      "refer to it within himself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you believe that he thinks of it much?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do,” said Miss Pross.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you imagine--” Mr. Lorry had begun, when Miss Pross took him up\n",
      "short with:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never imagine anything. Have no imagination at all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I stand corrected; do you suppose--you go so far as to suppose,\n",
      "sometimes?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now and then,” said Miss Pross.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you suppose,” Mr. Lorry went on, with a laughing twinkle in his\n",
      "bright eye, as it looked kindly at her, “that Doctor Manette has any\n",
      "theory of his own, preserved through all those years, relative to\n",
      "the cause of his being so oppressed; perhaps, even to the name of his\n",
      "oppressor?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t suppose anything about it but what Ladybird tells me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And that is--?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That she thinks he has.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now don’t be angry at my asking all these questions; because I am a\n",
      "mere dull man of business, and you are a woman of business.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dull?” Miss Pross inquired, with placidity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rather wishing his modest adjective away, Mr. Lorry replied, “No, no,\n",
      "no. Surely not. To return to business:--Is it not remarkable that Doctor\n",
      "Manette, unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all well assured\n",
      "he is, should never touch upon that question? I will not say with me,\n",
      "though he had business relations with me many years ago, and we are now\n",
      "intimate; I will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so devotedly\n",
      "attached, and who is so devotedly attached to him? Believe me, Miss\n",
      "Pross, I don’t approach the topic with you, out of curiosity, but out of\n",
      "zealous interest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well! To the best of my understanding, and bad’s the best, you’ll tell\n",
      "me,” said Miss Pross, softened by the tone of the apology, “he is afraid\n",
      "of the whole subject.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Afraid?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s plain enough, I should think, why he may be. It’s a dreadful\n",
      "remembrance. Besides that, his loss of himself grew out of it. Not\n",
      "knowing how he lost himself, or how he recovered himself, he may never\n",
      "feel certain of not losing himself again. That alone wouldn’t make the\n",
      "subject pleasant, I should think.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a profounder remark than Mr. Lorry had looked for. “True,” said\n",
      "he, “and fearful to reflect upon. Yet, a doubt lurks in my mind, Miss\n",
      "Pross, whether it is good for Doctor Manette to have that suppression\n",
      "always shut up within him. Indeed, it is this doubt and the uneasiness\n",
      "it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present confidence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can’t be helped,” said Miss Pross, shaking her head. “Touch that\n",
      "string, and he instantly changes for the worse. Better leave it alone.\n",
      "In short, must leave it alone, like or no like. Sometimes, he gets up in\n",
      "the dead of the night, and will be heard, by us overhead there, walking\n",
      "up and down, walking up and down, in his room. Ladybird has learnt to\n",
      "know then that his mind is walking up and down, walking up and down, in\n",
      "his old prison. She hurries to him, and they go on together, walking up\n",
      "and down, walking up and down, until he is composed. But he never says\n",
      "a word of the true reason of his restlessness, to her, and she finds it\n",
      "best not to hint at it to him. In silence they go walking up and down\n",
      "together, walking up and down together, till her love and company have\n",
      "brought him to himself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Notwithstanding Miss Pross’s denial of her own imagination, there was a\n",
      "perception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one sad idea,\n",
      "in her repetition of the phrase, walking up and down, which testified to\n",
      "her possessing such a thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes; it\n",
      "had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet, that it\n",
      "seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had\n",
      "set it going.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here they are!” said Miss Pross, rising to break up the conference;\n",
      "“and now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon!”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties, such a\n",
      "peculiar Ear of a place, that as Mr. Lorry stood at the open window,\n",
      "looking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard, he fancied\n",
      "they would never approach. Not only would the echoes die away, as though\n",
      "the steps had gone; but, echoes of other steps that never came would be\n",
      "heard in their stead, and would die away for good when they seemed close\n",
      "at hand. However, father and daughter did at last appear, and Miss Pross\n",
      "was ready at the street door to receive them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Pross was a pleasant sight, albeit wild, and red, and grim, taking\n",
      "off her darling’s bonnet when she came up-stairs, and touching it up\n",
      "with the ends of her handkerchief, and blowing the dust off it, and\n",
      "folding her mantle ready for laying by, and smoothing her rich hair with\n",
      "as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she\n",
      "had been the vainest and handsomest of women. Her darling was a pleasant\n",
      "sight too, embracing her and thanking her, and protesting against\n",
      "her taking so much trouble for her--which last she only dared to do\n",
      "playfully, or Miss Pross, sorely hurt, would have retired to her own\n",
      "chamber and cried. The Doctor was a pleasant sight too, looking on at\n",
      "them, and telling Miss Pross how she spoilt Lucie, in accents and with\n",
      "eyes that had as much spoiling in them as Miss Pross had, and would\n",
      "have had more if it were possible. Mr. Lorry was a pleasant sight too,\n",
      "beaming at all this in his little wig, and thanking his bachelor\n",
      "stars for having lighted him in his declining years to a Home. But, no\n",
      "Hundreds of people came to see the sights, and Mr. Lorry looked in vain\n",
      "for the fulfilment of Miss Pross’s prediction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dinner-time, and still no Hundreds of people. In the arrangements of\n",
      "the little household, Miss Pross took charge of the lower regions, and\n",
      "always acquitted herself marvellously. Her dinners, of a very modest\n",
      "quality, were so well cooked and so well served, and so neat in their\n",
      "contrivances, half English and half French, that nothing could be\n",
      "better. Miss Pross’s friendship being of the thoroughly practical\n",
      "kind, she had ravaged Soho and the adjacent provinces, in search of\n",
      "impoverished French, who, tempted by shillings and half-crowns, would\n",
      "impart culinary mysteries to her. From these decayed sons and daughters\n",
      "of Gaul, she had acquired such wonderful arts, that the woman and girl\n",
      "who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a Sorceress,\n",
      "or Cinderella’s Godmother: who would send out for a fowl, a rabbit,\n",
      "a vegetable or two from the garden, and change them into anything she\n",
      "pleased.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Sundays, Miss Pross dined at the Doctor’s table, but on other days\n",
      "persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods, either in the lower\n",
      "regions, or in her own room on the second floor--a blue chamber, to\n",
      "which no one but her Ladybird ever gained admittance. On this occasion,\n",
      "Miss Pross, responding to Ladybird’s pleasant face and pleasant efforts\n",
      "to please her, unbent exceedingly; so the dinner was very pleasant, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was an oppressive day, and, after dinner, Lucie proposed that the\n",
      "wine should be carried out under the plane-tree, and they should sit\n",
      "there in the air. As everything turned upon her, and revolved about her,\n",
      "they went out under the plane-tree, and she carried the wine down for\n",
      "the special benefit of Mr. Lorry. She had installed herself, some\n",
      "time before, as Mr. Lorry’s cup-bearer; and while they sat under the\n",
      "plane-tree, talking, she kept his glass replenished. Mysterious backs\n",
      "and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked, and the plane-tree\n",
      "whispered to them in its own way above their heads.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, the Hundreds of people did not present themselves. Mr. Darnay\n",
      "presented himself while they were sitting under the plane-tree, but he\n",
      "was only One.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctor Manette received him kindly, and so did Lucie. But, Miss Pross\n",
      "suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and body, and\n",
      "retired into the house. She was not unfrequently the victim of this\n",
      "disorder, and she called it, in familiar conversation, “a fit of the\n",
      "jerks.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Doctor was in his best condition, and looked specially young. The\n",
      "resemblance between him and Lucie was very strong at such times, and as\n",
      "they sat side by side, she leaning on his shoulder, and he resting\n",
      "his arm on the back of her chair, it was very agreeable to trace the\n",
      "likeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had been talking all day, on many subjects, and with unusual\n",
      "vivacity. “Pray, Doctor Manette,” said Mr. Darnay, as they sat under the\n",
      "plane-tree--and he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand,\n",
      "which happened to be the old buildings of London--“have you seen much of\n",
      "the Tower?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lucie and I have been there; but only casually. We have seen enough of\n",
      "it, to know that it teems with interest; little more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ have been there, as you remember,” said Darnay, with a smile,\n",
      "though reddening a little angrily, “in another character, and not in a\n",
      "character that gives facilities for seeing much of it. They told me a\n",
      "curious thing when I was there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What was that?” Lucie asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In making some alterations, the workmen came upon an old dungeon, which\n",
      "had been, for many years, built up and forgotten. Every stone of\n",
      "its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by\n",
      "prisoners--dates, names, complaints, and prayers. Upon a corner stone\n",
      "in an angle of the wall, one prisoner, who seemed to have gone to\n",
      "execution, had cut as his last work, three letters. They were done with\n",
      "some very poor instrument, and hurriedly, with an unsteady hand.\n",
      "At first, they were read as D. I. C.; but, on being more carefully\n",
      "examined, the last letter was found to be G. There was no record or\n",
      "legend of any prisoner with those initials, and many fruitless guesses\n",
      "were made what the name could have been. At length, it was suggested\n",
      "that the letters were not initials, but the complete word, DIG. The\n",

      "earth beneath a stone, or tile, or some fragment of paving, were found\n",
      "the ashes of a paper, mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case\n",

      "“My father,” exclaimed Lucie, “you are ill!”\n",

      "He had suddenly started up, with his hand to his head. His manner and\n",
      "his look quite terrified them all.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, my dear, not ill. There are large drops of rain falling, and they\n",
      "made me start. We had better go in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He recovered himself almost instantly. Rain was really falling in large\n",
      "drops, and he showed the back of his hand with rain-drops on it. But, he\n",
      "said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been told\n",
      "of, and, as they went into the house, the business eye of Mr. Lorry\n",
      "either detected, or fancied it detected, on his face, as it turned\n",
      "towards Charles Darnay, the same singular look that had been upon it\n",
      "when it turned towards him in the passages of the Court House.\n",
      "\n",
      "He recovered himself so quickly, however, that Mr. Lorry had doubts of\n",
      "his business eye. The arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more\n",
      "steady than he was, when he stopped under it to remark to them that he\n",
      "was not yet proof against slight surprises (if he ever would be), and\n",
      "that the rain had startled him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tea-time, and Miss Pross making tea, with another fit of the jerks upon\n",
      "her, and yet no Hundreds of people. Mr. Carton had lounged in, but he\n",
      "made only Two.\n",
      "\n",
      "The night was so very sultry, that although they sat with doors and\n",
      "windows open, they were overpowered by heat. When the tea-table was\n",
      "done with, they all moved to one of the windows, and looked out into the\n",
      "heavy twilight. Lucie sat by her father; Darnay sat beside her; Carton\n",
      "leaned against a window. The curtains were long and white, and some of\n",
      "the thunder-gusts that whirled into the corner, caught them up to the\n",
      "ceiling, and waved them like spectral wings.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The rain-drops are still falling, large, heavy, and few,” said Doctor\n",
      "Manette. “It comes slowly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It comes surely,” said Carton.\n",
      "\n",
      "They spoke low, as people watching and waiting mostly do; as people in a\n",
      "dark room, watching and waiting for Lightning, always do.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to\n",
      "get shelter before the storm broke; the wonderful corner for echoes\n",
      "resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going, yet not a\n",
      "footstep was there.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A multitude of people, and yet a solitude!” said Darnay, when they had\n",
      "listened for a while.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it not impressive, Mr. Darnay?” asked Lucie. “Sometimes, I have\n",
      "sat here of an evening, until I have fancied--but even the shade of\n",
      "a foolish fancy makes me shudder to-night, when all is so black and\n",
      "solemn--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let us shudder too. We may know what it is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It will seem nothing to you. Such whims are only impressive as we\n",
      "originate them, I think; they are not to be communicated. I have\n",
      "sometimes sat alone here of an evening, listening, until I have made\n",
      "the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming\n",
      "by-and-bye into our lives.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is a great crowd coming one day into our lives, if that be so,”\n",
      " Sydney Carton struck in, in his moody way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The footsteps were incessant, and the hurry of them became more and more\n",
      "rapid. The corner echoed and re-echoed with the tread of feet; some,\n",
      "as it seemed, under the windows; some, as it seemed, in the room; some\n",
      "coming, some going, some breaking off, some stopping altogether; all in\n",
      "the distant streets, and not one within sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are all these footsteps destined to come to all of us, Miss Manette, or\n",
      "are we to divide them among us?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know, Mr. Darnay; I told you it was a foolish fancy, but you\n",
      "asked for it. When I have yielded myself to it, I have been alone, and\n",
      "then I have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come\n",
      "into my life, and my father’s.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I take them into mine!” said Carton. “_I_ ask no questions and make no\n",
      "stipulations. There is a great crowd bearing down upon us, Miss Manette,\n",
      "and I see them--by the Lightning.” He added the last words, after there\n",
      "had been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And I hear them!” he added again, after a peal of thunder. “Here they\n",
      "come, fast, fierce, and furious!”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the rush and roar of rain that he typified, and it stopped him,\n",
      "for no voice could be heard in it. A memorable storm of thunder and\n",
      "lightning broke with that sweep of water, and there was not a moment’s\n",
      "interval in crash, and fire, and rain, until after the moon rose at\n",
      "midnight.\n",
      "\n",
      "The great bell of Saint Paul’s was striking one in the cleared air, when\n",
      "Mr. Lorry, escorted by Jerry, high-booted and bearing a lantern, set\n",
      "forth on his return-passage to Clerkenwell. There were solitary patches\n",
      "of road on the way between Soho and Clerkenwell, and Mr. Lorry, mindful\n",
      "of foot-pads, always retained Jerry for this service: though it was\n",
      "usually performed a good two hours earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What a night it has been! Almost a night, Jerry,” said Mr. Lorry, “to\n",

      "Monseigneur in Town\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Monseigneur, one of the great lords in power at the Court, held his\n",
      "fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in Paris. Monseigneur was in\n",
      "his inner room, his sanctuary of sanctuaries, the Holiest of Holiests to\n",
      "the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without. Monseigneur\n",
      "was about to take his chocolate. Monseigneur could swallow a great many\n",
      "things with ease, and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather\n",
      "rapidly swallowing France; but, his morning’s chocolate could not so\n",
      "much as get into the throat of Monseigneur, without the aid of four\n",
      "strong men besides the Cook.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. It took four men, all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration, and the\n",
      "Chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his\n",
      "pocket, emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by Monseigneur, to\n",
      "conduct the happy chocolate to Monseigneur’s lips. One lacquey carried\n",
      "the chocolate-pot into the sacred presence; a second, milled and frothed\n",
      "the chocolate with the little instrument he bore for that function;\n",
      "a third, presented the favoured napkin; a fourth (he of the two gold\n",
      "watches), poured the chocolate out. It was impossible for Monseigneur to\n",
      "dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high\n",
      "place under the admiring Heavens. Deep would have been the blot upon\n",
      "his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three\n",
      "men; he must have died of two.\n",
      "\n",
      "Monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night, where the Comedy\n",
      "and the Grand Opera were charmingly represented. Monseigneur was out at\n",
      "a little supper most nights, with fascinating company. So polite and so\n",
      "impressible was Monseigneur, that the Comedy and the Grand Opera had far\n",
      "more influence with him in the tiresome articles of state affairs and\n",
      "state secrets, than the needs of all France. A happy circumstance\n",
      "for France, as the like always is for all countries similarly\n",
      "favoured!--always was for England (by way of example), in the regretted\n",
      "days of the merry Stuart who sold it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business, which\n",
      "was, to let everything go on in its own way; of particular public\n",
      "business, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go\n",
      "his way--tend to his own power and pocket. Of his pleasures, general and\n",
      "particular, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea, that the world\n",
      "was made for them. The text of his order (altered from the original\n",
      "by only a pronoun, which is not much) ran: “The earth and the fulness\n",
      "thereof are mine, saith Monseigneur.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, Monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into\n",
      "his affairs, both private and public; and he had, as to both classes of\n",
      "affairs, allied himself perforce with a Farmer-General. As to finances\n",
      "public, because Monseigneur could not make anything at all of them, and\n",
      "must consequently let them out to somebody who could; as to finances\n",
      "private, because Farmer-Generals were rich, and Monseigneur, after\n",
      "generations of great luxury and expense, was growing poor. Hence\n",
      "Monseigneur had taken his sister from a convent, while there was yet\n",
      "time to ward off the impending veil, the cheapest garment she could\n",
      "wear, and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich Farmer-General,\n",
      "poor in family. Which Farmer-General, carrying an appropriate cane with\n",
      "a golden apple on the top of it, was now among the company in the outer\n",
      "rooms, much prostrated before by mankind--always excepting superior\n",
      "mankind of the blood of Monseigneur, who, his own wife included, looked\n",
      "down upon him with the loftiest contempt.\n",
      "\n",
      "A sumptuous man was the Farmer-General. Thirty horses stood in his\n",
      "stables, twenty-four male domestics sat in his halls, six body-women\n",
      "waited on his wife. As one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and\n",
      "forage where he could, the Farmer-General--howsoever his matrimonial\n",
      "relations conduced to social morality--was at least the greatest reality\n",
      "among the personages who attended at the hotel of Monseigneur that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "For, the rooms, though a beautiful scene to look at, and adorned with\n",
      "every device of decoration that the taste and skill of the time could\n",
      "achieve, were, in truth, not a sound business; considered with any\n",
      "reference to the scarecrows in the rags and nightcaps elsewhere (and not\n",
      "so far off, either, but that the watching towers of Notre Dame, almost\n",
      "equidistant from the two extremes, could see them both), they would\n",
      "have been an exceedingly uncomfortable business--if that could have\n",
      "been anybody’s business, at the house of Monseigneur. Military officers\n",
      "destitute of military knowledge; naval officers with no idea of a ship;\n",
      "civil officers without a notion of affairs; brazen ecclesiastics, of the\n",
      "worst world worldly, with sensual eyes, loose tongues, and looser lives;\n",
      "all totally unfit for their several callings, all lying horribly in\n",
      "pretending to belong to them, but all nearly or remotely of the order of\n",
      "Monseigneur, and therefore foisted on all public employments from which\n",
      "anything was to be got; these were to be told off by the score and the\n",
      "score. People not immediately connected with Monseigneur or the State,\n",
      "yet equally unconnected with anything that was real, or with lives\n",
      "passed in travelling by any straight road to any true earthly end, were\n",
      "no less abundant. Doctors who made great fortunes out of dainty remedies\n",
      "for imaginary disorders that never existed, smiled upon their courtly\n",
      "patients in the ante-chambers of Monseigneur. Projectors who had\n",
      "discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which the\n",
      "State was touched, except the remedy of setting to work in earnest to\n",
      "root out a single sin, poured their distracting babble into any ears\n",
      "they could lay hold of, at the reception of Monseigneur. Unbelieving\n",
      "Philosophers who were remodelling the world with words, and making\n",
      "card-towers of Babel to scale the skies with, talked with Unbelieving\n",
      "Chemists who had an eye on the transmutation of metals, at this\n",
      "wonderful gathering accumulated by Monseigneur. Exquisite gentlemen of\n",
      "the finest breeding, which was at that remarkable time--and has been\n",
      "since--to be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural\n",
      "subject of human interest, were in the most exemplary state of\n",
      "exhaustion, at the hotel of Monseigneur. Such homes had these various\n",
      "notabilities left behind them in the fine world of Paris, that the spies\n",
      "among the assembled devotees of Monseigneur--forming a goodly half\n",
      "of the polite company--would have found it hard to discover among\n",
      "the angels of that sphere one solitary wife, who, in her manners and\n",
      "appearance, owned to being a Mother. Indeed, except for the mere act of\n",
      "bringing a troublesome creature into this world--which does not go far\n",
      "towards the realisation of the name of mother--there was no such thing\n",
      "known to the fashion. Peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close,\n",
      "and brought them up, and charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and\n",
      "supped as at twenty.\n",
      "\n",
      "The leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance\n",
      "upon Monseigneur. In the outermost room were half a dozen exceptional\n",
      "people who had had, for a few years, some vague misgiving in them that\n",
      "things in general were going rather wrong. As a promising way of setting\n",
      "them right, half of the half-dozen had become members of a fantastic\n",
      "sect of Convulsionists, and were even then considering within themselves\n",
      "whether they should foam, rage, roar, and turn cataleptic on the\n",
      "spot--thereby setting up a highly intelligible finger-post to the\n",
      "Future, for Monseigneur’s guidance. Besides these Dervishes, were other\n",
      "three who had rushed into another sect, which mended matters with a\n",
      "jargon about “the Centre of Truth:” holding that Man had got out of the\n",
      "Centre of Truth--which did not need much demonstration--but had not got\n",
      "out of the Circumference, and that he was to be kept from flying out of\n",
      "the Circumference, and was even to be shoved back into the Centre,\n",
      "by fasting and seeing of spirits. Among these, accordingly, much\n",
      "discoursing with spirits went on--and it did a world of good which never\n",
      "became manifest.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, the comfort was, that all the company at the grand hotel of\n",
      "Monseigneur were perfectly dressed. If the Day of Judgment had only been\n",
      "ascertained to be a dress day, everybody there would have been eternally\n",
      "correct. Such frizzling and powdering and sticking up of hair, such\n",
      "delicate complexions artificially preserved and mended, such gallant\n",
      "swords to look at, and such delicate honour to the sense of smell, would\n",
      "surely keep anything going, for ever and ever. The exquisite gentlemen\n",
      "of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as they\n",
      "languidly moved; these golden fetters rang like precious little bells;\n",
      "and what with that ringing, and with the rustle of silk and brocade and\n",
      "fine linen, there was a flutter in the air that fanned Saint Antoine and\n",
      "his devouring hunger far away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping all\n",
      "things in their places. Everybody was dressed for a Fancy Ball that\n",
      "was never to leave off. From the Palace of the Tuileries, through\n",
      "Monseigneur and the whole Court, through the Chambers, the Tribunals\n",
      "of Justice, and all society (except the scarecrows), the Fancy Ball\n",
      "descended to the Common Executioner: who, in pursuance of the charm, was\n",
      "required to officiate “frizzled, powdered, in a gold-laced coat, pumps,\n",
      "and white silk stockings.” At the gallows and the wheel--the axe was a\n",
      "rarity--Monsieur Paris, as it was the episcopal mode among his brother\n",
      "Professors of the provinces, Monsieur Orleans, and the rest, to call\n",
      "him, presided in this dainty dress. And who among the company at\n",
      "Monseigneur’s reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year\n",
      "of our Lord, could possibly doubt, that a system rooted in a frizzled\n",
      "hangman, powdered, gold-laced, pumped, and white-silk stockinged, would\n",
      "see the very stars out!\n",
      "\n",
      "Monseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken his\n",
      "chocolate, caused the doors of the Holiest of Holiests to be thrown\n",
      "open, and issued forth. Then, what submission, what cringing and\n",
      "fawning, what servility, what abject humiliation! As to bowing down in\n",
      "body and spirit, nothing in that way was left for Heaven--which may have\n",
      "been one among other reasons why the worshippers of Monseigneur never\n",
      "troubled it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there, a whisper on one\n",
      "happy slave and a wave of the hand on another, Monseigneur affably\n",
      "passed through his rooms to the remote region of the Circumference of\n",
      "Truth. There, Monseigneur turned, and came back again, and so in due\n",
      "course of time got himself shut up in his sanctuary by the chocolate\n",
      "sprites, and was seen no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "The show being over, the flutter in the air became quite a little storm,\n",
      "and the precious little bells went ringing downstairs. There was soon\n",
      "but one person left of all the crowd, and he, with his hat under his arm\n",
      "and his snuff-box in his hand, slowly passed among the mirrors on his\n",
      "way out.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I devote you,” said this person, stopping at the last door on his way,\n",
      "and turning in the direction of the sanctuary, “to the Devil!”\n",
      "\n",
      "With that, he shook the snuff from his fingers as if he had shaken the\n",
      "dust from his feet, and quietly walked downstairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was a man of about sixty, handsomely dressed, haughty in manner, and\n",
      "with a face like a fine mask. A face of a transparent paleness; every\n",
      "feature in it clearly defined; one set expression on it. The nose,\n",
      "beautifully formed otherwise, was very slightly pinched at the top\n",
      "of each nostril. In those two compressions, or dints, the only little\n",
      "change that the face ever showed, resided. They persisted in changing\n",
      "colour sometimes, and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted\n",
      "by something like a faint pulsation; then, they gave a look of\n",
      "treachery, and cruelty, to the whole countenance. Examined with\n",
      "attention, its capacity of helping such a look was to be found in the\n",
      "line of the mouth, and the lines of the orbits of the eyes, being much\n",
      "too horizontal and thin; still, in the effect of the face made, it was a\n",
      "handsome face, and a remarkable one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its owner went downstairs into the courtyard, got into his carriage, and\n",
      "drove away. Not many people had talked with him at the reception; he had\n",
      "stood in a little space apart, and Monseigneur might have been warmer\n",
      "in his manner. It appeared, under the circumstances, rather agreeable\n",
      "to him to see the common people dispersed before his horses, and\n",
      "often barely escaping from being run down. His man drove as if he were\n",
      "charging an enemy, and the furious recklessness of the man brought no\n",
      "check into the face, or to the lips, of the master. The complaint had\n",
      "sometimes made itself audible, even in that deaf city and dumb age,\n",
      "that, in the narrow streets without footways, the fierce patrician\n",
      "custom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar in a\n",
      "barbarous manner. But, few cared enough for that to think of it a second\n",
      "time, and, in this matter, as in all others, the common wretches were\n",
      "left to get out of their difficulties as they could.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a wild rattle and clatter, and an inhuman abandonment of\n",
      "consideration not easy to be understood in these days, the carriage\n",
      "dashed through streets and swept round corners, with women screaming\n",
      "before it, and men clutching each other and clutching children out of\n",
      "its way. At last, swooping at a street corner by a fountain, one of its\n",
      "wheels came to a sickening little jolt, and there was a loud cry from a\n",
      "number of voices, and the horses reared and plunged.\n",
      "\n",
      "But for the latter inconvenience, the carriage probably would not have\n",
      "stopped; carriages were often known to drive on, and leave their wounded\n",
      "behind, and why not? But the frightened valet had got down in a hurry,\n",
      "and there were twenty hands at the horses’ bridles.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What has gone wrong?” said Monsieur, calmly looking out.\n",
      "\n",
      "A tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among the feet of\n",
      "the horses, and had laid it on the basement of the fountain, and was\n",
      "down in the mud and wet, howling over it like a wild animal.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pardon, Monsieur the Marquis!” said a ragged and submissive man, “it is\n",
      "a child.”\n",
      "\n",

      "The fountain was a little removed; for the street opened, where it was,\n",
      "into a space some ten or twelve yards square. As the tall man suddenly\n",
      "got up from the ground, and came running at the carriage, Monsieur the\n",
      "Marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his sword-hilt.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Killed!” shrieked the man, in wild desperation, extending both arms at\n",

      "\n",
      "The people closed round, and looked at Monsieur the Marquis. There was\n",
      "nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness\n",
      "and eagerness; there was no visible menacing or anger. Neither did the\n",
      "people say anything; after the first cry, they had been silent, and they\n",
      "remained so. The voice of the submissive man who had spoken, was flat\n",
      "and tame in its extreme submission. Monsieur the Marquis ran his eyes\n",
      "over them all, as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“It is extraordinary to me,” said he, “that you people cannot take care\n",
      "of yourselves and your children. One or the other of you is for ever in\n",
      "the way. How do I know what injury you have done my horses. See! Give\n",
      "him that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up, and all the heads\n",
      "craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell. The\n",
      "tall man called out again with a most unearthly cry, “Dead!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He was arrested by the quick arrival of another man, for whom the rest\n",
      "made way. On seeing him, the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder,\n",
      "sobbing and crying, and pointing to the fountain, where some women were\n",
      "stooping over the motionless bundle, and moving gently about it. They\n",
      "were as silent, however, as the men.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know all, I know all,” said the last comer. “Be a brave man, my\n",

      "Without deigning to look at the assemblage a second time, Monsieur the\n",
      "Marquis leaned back in his seat, and was just being driven away with the\n",
      "air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common thing, and had\n",
      "paid for it, and could afford to pay for it; when his ease was suddenly\n",
      "disturbed by a coin flying into his carriage, and ringing on its floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold!” said Monsieur the Marquis. “Hold the horses! Who threw that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked to the spot where Defarge the vendor of wine had stood, a\n",
      "moment before; but the wretched father was grovelling on his face on\n",
      "the pavement in that spot, and the figure that stood beside him was the\n",
      "figure of a dark stout woman, knitting.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You dogs!” said the Marquis, but smoothly, and with an unchanged front,\n",
      "except as to the spots on his nose: “I would ride over any of you very\n",
      "willingly, and exterminate you from the earth. If I knew which rascal\n",
      "threw at the carriage, and if that brigand were sufficiently near it, he\n",
      "should be crushed under the wheels.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So cowed was their condition, and so long and hard their experience of\n",
      "what such a man could do to them, within the law and beyond it, that not\n",
      "a voice, or a hand, or even an eye was raised. Among the men, not one.\n",
      "But the woman who stood knitting looked up steadily, and looked the\n",
      "Marquis in the face. It was not for his dignity to notice it; his\n",
      "contemptuous eyes passed over her, and over all the other rats; and he\n",
      "leaned back in his seat again, and gave the word “Go on!”\n",
      "\n",

      "whole Fancy Ball in a bright continuous flow, came whirling by. The rats\n",
      "had crept out of their holes to look on, and they remained looking\n",
      "on for hours; soldiers and police often passing between them and the\n",
      "spectacle, and making a barrier behind which they slunk, and through\n",
      "which they peeped. The father had long ago taken up his bundle and\n",
      "bidden himself away with it, when the women who had tended the bundle\n",
      "while it lay on the base of the fountain, sat there watching the running\n",
      "of the water and the rolling of the Fancy Ball--when the one woman who\n",
      "had stood conspicuous, knitting, still knitted on with the steadfastness\n",
      "of Fate. The water of the fountain ran, the swift river ran, the day ran\n",
      "into evening, so much life in the city ran into death according to rule,\n",
      "time and tide waited for no man, the rats were sleeping close together\n",

      "Few children were to be seen, and no dogs. As to the men and women,\n",

      "his travelling carriage at the posting-house gate. It was hard by the\n",

      "He looked at them, and saw in them, without knowing it, the slow\n",
      "sure filing down of misery-worn face and figure, that was to make the\n",

      "business altogether, with heavy stone balustrades, and stone urns, and\n",
      "stone flowers, and stone faces of men, and stone heads of lions, in\n",

      "Up the broad flight of shallow steps, Monsieur the Marquis, flambeau\n",

      "room, in one of the chateau’s four extinguisher-topped towers. A small\n",
      "lofty room, with its window wide open, and the wooden jalousie-blinds\n",
      "closed, so that the dark night only showed in slight horizontal lines of\n",
      "black, alternating with their broad lines of stone colour.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My nephew,” said the Marquis, glancing at the supper preparation; “they\n",
      "said he was not arrived.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor was he; but, he had been expected with Monseigneur.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! It is not probable he will arrive to-night; nevertheless, leave the\n",

      "\n",
      "In a quarter of an hour Monseigneur was ready, and sat down alone to his\n",

      "he had taken his soup, and was raising his glass of Bordeaux to his\n",
      "lips, when he put it down.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is that?” he calmly asked, looking with attention at the\n",

      "\n",
      "“Monseigneur? That?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Outside the blinds. Open the blinds.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was done.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monseigneur, it is nothing. The trees and the night are all that are\n",
      "here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The servant who spoke, had thrown the blinds wide, had looked out into\n",
      "the vacant darkness, and stood with that blank behind him, looking round\n",
      "for instructions.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good,” said the imperturbable master. “Close them again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That was done too, and the Marquis went on with his supper. He was\n",
      "half way through it, when he again stopped with his glass in his hand,\n",
      "hearing the sound of wheels. It came on briskly, and came up to the\n",
      "front of the chateau.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ask who is arrived.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the nephew of Monseigneur. He had been some few leagues behind\n",
      "Monseigneur, early in the afternoon. He had diminished the distance\n",
      "rapidly, but not so rapidly as to come up with Monseigneur on the road.\n",
      "He had heard of Monseigneur, at the posting-houses, as being before him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was to be told (said Monseigneur) that supper awaited him then and\n",
      "there, and that he was prayed to come to it. In a little while he came.\n",
      "He had been known in England as Charles Darnay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Monseigneur received him in a courtly manner, but they did not shake\n",
      "hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You left Paris yesterday, sir?” he said to Monseigneur, as he took his\n",
      "seat at table.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yesterday. And you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I come direct.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“From London?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have been a long time coming,” said the Marquis, with a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "“On the contrary; I come direct.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pardon me! I mean, not a long time on the journey; a long time\n",
      "intending the journey.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have been detained by”--the nephew stopped a moment in his\n",
      "answer--“various business.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Without doubt,” said the polished uncle.\n",
      "\n",
      "So long as a servant was present, no other words passed between them.\n",
      "When coffee had been served and they were alone together, the nephew,\n",
      "looking at the uncle and meeting the eyes of the face that was like a\n",
      "fine mask, opened a conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have come back, sir, as you anticipate, pursuing the object that\n",
      "took me away. It carried me into great and unexpected peril; but it is\n",
      "a sacred object, and if it had carried me to death I hope it would have\n",
      "sustained me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not to death,” said the uncle; “it is not necessary to say, to death.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I doubt, sir,” returned the nephew, “whether, if it had carried me to\n",
      "the utmost brink of death, you would have cared to stop me there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The deepened marks in the nose, and the lengthening of the fine straight\n",
      "lines in the cruel face, looked ominous as to that; the uncle made a\n",
      "graceful gesture of protest, which was so clearly a slight form of good\n",
      "breeding that it was not reassuring.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed, sir,” pursued the nephew, “for anything I know, you may have\n",
      "expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious\n",
      "circumstances that surrounded me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no, no,” said the uncle, pleasantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, however that may be,” resumed the nephew, glancing at him with\n",
      "deep distrust, “I know that your diplomacy would stop me by any means,\n",
      "and would know no scruple as to means.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My friend, I told you so,” said the uncle, with a fine pulsation in the\n",
      "two marks. “Do me the favour to recall that I told you so, long ago.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I recall it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you,” said the Marquis--very sweetly indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "His tone lingered in the air, almost like the tone of a musical\n",
      "instrument.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In effect, sir,” pursued the nephew, “I believe it to be at once your\n",
      "bad fortune, and my good fortune, that has kept me out of a prison in\n",
      "France here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not quite understand,” returned the uncle, sipping his coffee.\n",
      "“Dare I ask you to explain?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I believe that if you were not in disgrace with the Court, and had not\n",
      "been overshadowed by that cloud for years past, a letter de cachet would\n",
      "have sent me to some fortress indefinitely.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is possible,” said the uncle, with great calmness. “For the honour\n",
      "of the family, I could even resolve to incommode you to that extent.\n",
      "Pray excuse me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I perceive that, happily for me, the Reception of the day before\n",
      "yesterday was, as usual, a cold one,” observed the nephew.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I would not say happily, my friend,” returned the uncle, with refined\n",
      "politeness; “I would not be sure of that. A good opportunity for\n",
      "consideration, surrounded by the advantages of solitude, might influence\n",
      "your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for\n",
      "yourself. But it is useless to discuss the question. I am, as you say,\n",
      "at a disadvantage. These little instruments of correction, these gentle\n",
      "aids to the power and honour of families, these slight favours that\n",
      "might so incommode you, are only to be obtained now by interest\n",
      "and importunity. They are sought by so many, and they are granted\n",
      "(comparatively) to so few! It used not to be so, but France in all such\n",
      "things is changed for the worse. Our not remote ancestors held the right\n",
      "of life and death over the surrounding vulgar. From this room, many such\n",
      "dogs have been taken out to be hanged; in the next room (my bedroom),\n",
      "one fellow, to our knowledge, was poniarded on the spot for professing\n",
      "some insolent delicacy respecting his daughter--_his_ daughter? We have\n",
      "lost many privileges; a new philosophy has become the mode; and the\n",
      "assertion of our station, in these days, might (I do not go so far as\n",
      "to say would, but might) cause us real inconvenience. All very bad, very\n",
      "bad!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff, and shook his head;\n",
      "as elegantly despondent as he could becomingly be of a country still\n",
      "containing himself, that great means of regeneration.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have so asserted our station, both in the old time and in the modern\n",
      "time also,” said the nephew, gloomily, “that I believe our name to be\n",
      "more detested than any name in France.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let us hope so,” said the uncle. “Detestation of the high is the\n",
      "involuntary homage of the low.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is not,” pursued the nephew, in his former tone, “a face I can\n",
      "look at, in all this country round about us, which looks at me with any\n",
      "deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A compliment,” said the Marquis, “to the grandeur of the family,\n",
      "merited by the manner in which the family has sustained its grandeur.\n",
      "Hah!” And he took another gentle little pinch of snuff, and lightly\n",
      "crossed his legs.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, when his nephew, leaning an elbow on the table, covered his eyes\n",
      "thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand, the fine mask looked at\n",
      "him sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness, closeness,\n",
      "and dislike, than was comportable with its wearer’s assumption of\n",
      "indifference.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Repression is the only lasting philosophy. The dark deference of fear\n",
      "and slavery, my friend,” observed the Marquis, “will keep the dogs\n",
      "obedient to the whip, as long as this roof,” looking up to it, “shuts\n",
      "out the sky.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That might not be so long as the Marquis supposed. If a picture of the\n",
      "chateau as it was to be a very few years hence, and of fifty like it as\n",
      "they too were to be a very few years hence, could have been shown to\n",
      "him that night, he might have been at a loss to claim his own from\n",
      "the ghastly, fire-charred, plunder-wrecked rains. As for the roof\n",
      "he vaunted, he might have found _that_ shutting out the sky in a new\n",
      "way--to wit, for ever, from the eyes of the bodies into which its lead\n",
      "was fired, out of the barrels of a hundred thousand muskets.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Meanwhile,” said the Marquis, “I will preserve the honour and repose\n",
      "of the family, if you will not. But you must be fatigued. Shall we\n",
      "terminate our conference for the night?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A moment more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“An hour, if you please.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sir,” said the nephew, “we have done wrong, and are reaping the fruits\n",
      "of wrong.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_We_ have done wrong?” repeated the Marquis, with an inquiring smile,\n",
      "and delicately pointing, first to his nephew, then to himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Our family; our honourable family, whose honour is of so much account\n",
      "to both of us, in such different ways. Even in my father’s time, we did\n",
      "a world of wrong, injuring every human creature who came between us and\n",
      "our pleasure, whatever it was. Why need I speak of my father’s time,\n",
      "when it is equally yours? Can I separate my father’s twin-brother, joint\n",
      "inheritor, and next successor, from himself?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Death has done that!” said the Marquis.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And has left me,” answered the nephew, “bound to a system that is\n",
      "frightful to me, responsible for it, but powerless in it; seeking to\n",
      "execute the last request of my dear mother’s lips, and obey the last\n",
      "look of my dear mother’s eyes, which implored me to have mercy and to\n",
      "redress; and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Seeking them from me, my nephew,” said the Marquis, touching him on the\n",
      "breast with his forefinger--they were now standing by the hearth--“you\n",
      "will for ever seek them in vain, be assured.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his face, was\n",
      "cruelly, craftily, and closely compressed, while he stood looking\n",
      "quietly at his nephew, with his snuff-box in his hand. Once again he\n",
      "touched him on the breast, as though his finger were the fine point of\n",
      "a small sword, with which, in delicate finesse, he ran him through the\n",
      "body, and said,\n",
      "\n",
      "“My friend, I will die, perpetuating the system under which I have\n",
      "lived.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had said it, he took a culminating pinch of snuff, and put his\n",
      "box in his pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Better to be a rational creature,” he added then, after ringing a small\n",
      "bell on the table, “and accept your natural destiny. But you are lost,\n",
      "Monsieur Charles, I see.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This property and France are lost to me,” said the nephew, sadly; “I\n",
      "renounce them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are they both yours to renounce? France may be, but is the property? It\n",
      "is scarcely worth mentioning; but, is it yet?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I had no intention, in the words I used, to claim it yet. If it passed\n",
      "to me from you, to-morrow--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Which I have the vanity to hope is not probable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“--or twenty years hence--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You do me too much honour,” said the Marquis; “still, I prefer that\n",
      "supposition.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“--I would abandon it, and live otherwise and elsewhere. It is little to\n",
      "relinquish. What is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hah!” said the Marquis, glancing round the luxurious room.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To the eye it is fair enough, here; but seen in its integrity,\n",
      "under the sky, and by the daylight, it is a crumbling tower of waste,\n",
      "mismanagement, extortion, debt, mortgage, oppression, hunger, nakedness,\n",
      "and suffering.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hah!” said the Marquis again, in a well-satisfied manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If it ever becomes mine, it shall be put into some hands better\n",
      "qualified to free it slowly (if such a thing is possible) from the\n",
      "weight that drags it down, so that the miserable people who cannot leave\n",
      "it and who have been long wrung to the last point of endurance, may, in\n",
      "another generation, suffer less; but it is not for me. There is a curse\n",
      "on it, and on all this land.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And you?” said the uncle. “Forgive my curiosity; do you, under your new\n",
      "philosophy, graciously intend to live?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I must do, to live, what others of my countrymen, even with nobility at\n",
      "their backs, may have to do some day--work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In England, for example?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. The family honour, sir, is safe from me in this country. The\n",
      "family name can suffer from me in no other, for I bear it in no other.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bed-chamber to be\n",
      "lighted. It now shone brightly, through the door of communication. The\n",
      "Marquis looked that way, and listened for the retreating step of his\n",
      "valet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“England is very attractive to you, seeing how indifferently you have\n",
      "prospered there,” he observed then, turning his calm face to his nephew\n",
      "with a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have already said, that for my prospering there, I am sensible I may\n",
      "be indebted to you, sir. For the rest, it is my Refuge.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They say, those boastful English, that it is the Refuge of many. You\n",
      "know a compatriot who has found a Refuge there? A Doctor?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“With a daughter?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said the Marquis. “You are fatigued. Good night!”\n",
      "\n",
      "As he bent his head in his most courtly manner, there was a secrecy\n",
      "in his smiling face, and he conveyed an air of mystery to those words,\n",
      "which struck the eyes and ears of his nephew forcibly. At the same\n",
      "time, the thin straight lines of the setting of the eyes, and the thin\n",
      "straight lips, and the markings in the nose, curved with a sarcasm that\n",
      "looked handsomely diabolic.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” repeated the Marquis. “A Doctor with a daughter. Yes. So\n",
      "commences the new philosophy! You are fatigued. Good night!”\n",
      "\n",
      "It would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face\n",
      "outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his. The nephew\n",
      "looked at him, in vain, in passing on to the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good night!” said the uncle. “I look to the pleasure of seeing you\n",
      "again in the morning. Good repose! Light Monsieur my nephew to his\n",
      "chamber there!--And burn Monsieur my nephew in his bed, if you will,” he\n",
      "added to himself, before he rang his little bell again, and summoned his\n",
      "valet to his own bedroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "The valet come and gone, Monsieur the Marquis walked to and fro in his\n",
      "loose chamber-robe, to prepare himself gently for sleep, that hot still\n",
      "night. Rustling about the room, his softly-slippered feet making no\n",
      "noise on the floor, he moved like a refined tiger:--looked like some\n",
      "enchanted marquis of the impenitently wicked sort, in story, whose\n",
      "periodical change into tiger form was either just going off, or just\n",
      "coming on.\n",
      "\n",
      "He moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom, looking again at the\n",
      "scraps of the day’s journey that came unbidden into his mind; the slow\n",
      "toil up the hill at sunset, the setting sun, the descent, the mill, the\n",
      "prison on the crag, the little village in the hollow, the peasants at\n",
      "the fountain, and the mender of roads with his blue cap pointing out the\n",
      "chain under the carriage. That fountain suggested the Paris fountain,\n",
      "the little bundle lying on the step, the women bending over it, and the\n",
      "tall man with his arms up, crying, “Dead!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am cool now,” said Monsieur the Marquis, “and may go to bed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So, leaving only one light burning on the large hearth, he let his thin\n",
      "gauze curtains fall around him, and heard the night break its silence\n",
      "with a long sigh as he composed himself to sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly at the black night\n",
      "for three heavy hours; for three heavy hours, the horses in the stables\n",
      "rattled at their racks, the dogs barked, and the owl made a noise with\n",
      "very little resemblance in it to the noise conventionally assigned to\n",
      "the owl by men-poets. But it is the obstinate custom of such creatures\n",
      "hardly ever to say what is set down for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "For three heavy hours, the stone faces of the chateau, lion and human,\n",
      "stared blindly at the night. Dead darkness lay on all the landscape,\n",
      "dead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on all the roads.\n",
      "The burial-place had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass\n",
      "were undistinguishable from one another; the figure on the Cross might\n",
      "have come down, for anything that could be seen of it. In the village,\n",
      "taxers and taxed were fast asleep. Dreaming, perhaps, of banquets, as\n",
      "the starved usually do, and of ease and rest, as the driven slave and\n",
      "the yoked ox may, its lean inhabitants slept soundly, and were fed and\n",
      "freed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fountain in the village flowed unseen and unheard, and the fountain\n",
      "at the chateau dropped unseen and unheard--both melting away, like the\n",
      "minutes that were falling from the spring of Time--through three dark\n",
      "hours. Then, the grey water of both began to be ghostly in the light,\n",
      "and the eyes of the stone faces of the chateau were opened.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lighter and lighter, until at last the sun touched the tops of the still\n",
      "trees, and poured its radiance over the hill. In the glow, the water\n",
      "of the chateau fountain seemed to turn to blood, and the stone faces\n",
      "crimsoned. The carol of the birds was loud and high, and, on the\n",
      "weather-beaten sill of the great window of the bed-chamber of Monsieur\n",
      "the Marquis, one little bird sang its sweetest song with all its might.\n",
      "At this, the nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed, and, with open\n",
      "mouth and dropped under-jaw, looked awe-stricken.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the sun was full up, and movement began in the village. Casement\n",
      "windows opened, crazy doors were unbarred, and people came forth\n",

      "fountain; some, to the fields; men and women here, to dig and delve; men\n",
      "and women there, to see to the poor live stock, and lead the bony cows\n",
      "out, to such pasture as could be found by the roadside. In the church\n",
      "and at the Cross, a kneeling figure or two; attendant on the latter\n",

      "The chateau awoke later, as became its quality, but awoke gradually and\n",
      "surely. First, the lonely boar-spears and knives of the chase had been\n",
      "reddened as of old; then, had gleamed trenchant in the morning sunshine;\n",
      "now, doors and windows were thrown open, horses in their stables looked\n",
      "round over their shoulders at the light and freshness pouring in at\n",
      "doorways, leaves sparkled and rustled at iron-grated windows, dogs\n",
      "pulled hard at their chains, and reared impatient to be loosed.\n",
      "\n",
      "All these trivial incidents belonged to the routine of life, and the\n",
      "return of morning. Surely, not so the ringing of the great bell of the\n",
      "chateau, nor the running up and down the stairs; nor the hurried\n",
      "figures on the terrace; nor the booting and tramping here and there and\n",
      "everywhere, nor the quick saddling of horses and riding away?\n",

      "much to carry) lying in a bundle that it was worth no crow’s while to\n",
      "peck at, on a heap of stones? Had the birds, carrying some grains of it\n",
      "to a distance, dropped one over him as they sow chance seeds? Whether or\n",
      "no, the mender of roads ran, on the sultry morning, as if for his life,\n",

      "on, or lying down chewing the cud of nothing particularly repaying their\n",

      "all the taxing authorities, were armed more or less, and were crowded\n",
      "on the other side of the little street in a purposeless way, that was\n",
      "highly fraught with nothing. Already, the mender of roads had penetrated\n",
      "into the midst of a group of fifty particular friends, and was smiting\n",
      "himself in the breast with his blue cap. What did all this portend,\n",
      "and what portended the swift hoisting-up of Monsieur Gabelle behind\n",
      "a servant on horseback, and the conveying away of the said Gabelle\n",

      "More months, to the number of twelve, had come and gone, and Mr. Charles\n",
      "Darnay was established in England as a higher teacher of the French\n",
      "language who was conversant with French literature. In this age, he\n",
      "would have been a Professor; in that age, he was a Tutor. He read with\n",
      "young men who could find any leisure and interest for the study of a\n",
      "living tongue spoken all over the world, and he cultivated a taste for\n",
      "its stores of knowledge and fancy. He could write of them, besides, in\n",
      "sound English, and render them into sound English. Such masters were not\n",
      "at that time easily found; Princes that had been, and Kings that were\n",
      "to be, were not yet of the Teacher class, and no ruined nobility had\n",
      "dropped out of Tellson’s ledgers, to turn cooks and carpenters. As a\n",
      "tutor, whose attainments made the student’s way unusually pleasant and\n",
      "profitable, and as an elegant translator who brought something to his\n",
      "work besides mere dictionary knowledge, young Mr. Darnay soon became\n",
      "known and encouraged. He was well acquainted, more-over, with the\n",
      "circumstances of his country, and those were of ever-growing interest.\n",
      "So, with great perseverance and untiring industry, he prospered.\n",
      "\n",
      "In London, he had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold, nor\n",
      "to lie on beds of roses; if he had had any such exalted expectation, he\n",

      "A certain portion of his time was passed at Cambridge, where he\n",
      "read with undergraduates as a sort of tolerated smuggler who drove a\n",
      "contraband trade in European languages, instead of conveying Greek\n",
      "and Latin through the Custom-house. The rest of his time he passed in\n",
      "London.\n",

      "Now, from the days when it was always summer in Eden, to these days\n",
      "when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes, the world of a man has\n",
      "invariably gone one way--Charles Darnay’s way--the way of the love of a\n",
      "woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had loved Lucie Manette from the hour of his danger. He had never\n",

      "he had never seen a face so tenderly beautiful, as hers when it was\n",
      "confronted with his own on the edge of the grave that had been dug for\n",
      "him. But, he had not yet spoken to her on the subject; the assassination\n",
      "at the deserted chateau far away beyond the heaving water and the long,\n",
      "long, dusty roads--the solid stone chateau which had itself become the\n",

      "much as a single spoken word, disclosed to her the state of his heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "That he had his reasons for this, he knew full well. It was again a\n",
      "summer day when, lately arrived in London from his college occupation,\n",
      "he turned into the quiet corner in Soho, bent on seeking an opportunity\n",
      "of opening his mind to Doctor Manette. It was the close of the summer\n",
      "day, and he knew Lucie to be out with Miss Pross.\n",
      "\n",
      "He found the Doctor reading in his arm-chair at a window. The energy\n",
      "which had at once supported him under his old sufferings and aggravated\n",
      "their sharpness, had been gradually restored to him. He was now a\n",
      "very energetic man indeed, with great firmness of purpose, strength\n",
      "of resolution, and vigour of action. In his recovered energy he was\n",
      "sometimes a little fitful and sudden, as he had at first been in the\n",
      "exercise of his other recovered faculties; but, this had never been\n",
      "frequently observable, and had grown more and more rare.\n",
      "\n",
      "He studied much, slept little, sustained a great deal of fatigue with\n",
      "ease, and was equably cheerful. To him, now entered Charles Darnay, at\n",

      "\n",
      "“Charles Darnay! I rejoice to see you. We have been counting on your\n",

      "\n",
      "“She is.”\n",
      "\n",

      "“It is a tone of fervent admiration, true homage, and deep love, Doctor\n",

      "His constraint was so manifest, and it was so manifest, too, that it\n",

      "“Shall I go on, sir?”\n",

      "I say it, how earnestly I feel it, without knowing my secret heart, and\n",
      "the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been\n",
      "laden. Dear Doctor Manette, I love your daughter fondly, dearly,\n",
      "disinterestedly, devotedly. If ever there were love in the world, I love\n",
      "her. You have loved yourself; let your old love speak for me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Doctor sat with his face turned away, and his eyes bent on the\n",

      "“Not that, sir! Let that be! I adjure you, do not recall that!”\n",

      "He turned towards him in his chair, but did not look at him, or\n",

      "\n",
      "He offered his hand; but his eyes did not go with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know,” said Darnay, respectfully, “how can I fail to know, Doctor\n",
      "Manette, I who have seen you together from day to day, that between\n",
      "you and Miss Manette there is an affection so unusual, so touching, so\n",
      "belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured, that it\n",
      "can have few parallels, even in the tenderness between a father and\n",
      "child. I know, Doctor Manette--how can I fail to know--that, mingled\n",
      "with the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman, there\n",
      "is, in her heart, towards you, all the love and reliance of infancy\n",
      "itself. I know that, as in her childhood she had no parent, so she is\n",
      "now devoted to you with all the constancy and fervour of her present\n",
      "years and character, united to the trustfulness and attachment of the\n",
      "early days in which you were lost to her. I know perfectly well that if\n",
      "you had been restored to her from the world beyond this life, you could\n",
      "hardly be invested, in her sight, with a more sacred character than that\n",
      "in which you are always with her. I know that when she is clinging to\n",
      "you, the hands of baby, girl, and woman, all in one, are round your\n",
      "neck. I know that in loving you she sees and loves her mother at her\n",
      "own age, sees and loves you at my age, loves her mother broken-hearted,\n",
      "loves you through your dreadful trial and in your blessed restoration. I\n",
      "have known this, night and day, since I have known you in your home.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her father sat silent, with his face bent down. His breathing was a\n",
      "little quickened; but he repressed all other signs of agitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear Doctor Manette, always knowing this, always seeing her and you\n",
      "with this hallowed light about you, I have forborne, and forborne, as\n",
      "long as it was in the nature of man to do it. I have felt, and do even\n",
      "now feel, that to bring my love--even mine--between you, is to touch\n",
      "your history with something not quite so good as itself. But I love her.\n",
      "Heaven is my witness that I love her!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I believe it,” answered her father, mournfully. “I have thought so\n",
      "before now. I believe it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, do not believe,” said Darnay, upon whose ear the mournful voice\n",
      "struck with a reproachful sound, “that if my fortune were so cast as\n",
      "that, being one day so happy as to make her my wife, I must at any time\n",
      "put any separation between her and you, I could or would breathe a\n",
      "word of what I now say. Besides that I should know it to be hopeless, I\n",
      "should know it to be a baseness. If I had any such possibility, even at\n",
      "a remote distance of years, harboured in my thoughts, and hidden in my\n",
      "heart--if it ever had been there--if it ever could be there--I could not\n",
      "now touch this honoured hand.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He laid his own upon it as he spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, dear Doctor Manette. Like you, a voluntary exile from France; like\n",
      "you, driven from it by its distractions, oppressions, and miseries; like\n",
      "you, striving to live away from it by my own exertions, and trusting\n",
      "in a happier future; I look only to sharing your fortunes, sharing your\n",
      "life and home, and being faithful to you to the death. Not to divide\n",
      "with Lucie her privilege as your child, companion, and friend; but to\n",
      "come in aid of it, and bind her closer to you, if such a thing can be.”\n",
      "\n",
      "His touch still lingered on her father’s hand. Answering the touch for a\n",
      "moment, but not coldly, her father rested his hands upon the arms of\n",
      "his chair, and looked up for the first time since the beginning of the\n",
      "conference. A struggle was evidently in his face; a struggle with that\n",
      "occasional look which had a tendency in it to dark doubt and dread.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You speak so feelingly and so manfully, Charles Darnay, that I thank\n",
      "you with all my heart, and will open all my heart--or nearly so. Have\n",
      "you any reason to believe that Lucie loves you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“None. As yet, none.”\n",
      "\n",

      "ascertain that, with my knowledge?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not even so. I might not have the hopefulness to do it for weeks; I\n",
      "might (mistaken or not mistaken) have that hopefulness to-morrow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you seek any guidance from me?”\n",
      "\n",

      "“What is it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I well understand that, without you, I could have no hope. I well\n",
      "understand that, even if Miss Manette held me at this moment in her\n",
      "innocent heart--do not think I have the presumption to assume so much--I\n",
      "could retain no place in it against her love for her father.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If that be so, do you see what, on the other hand, is involved in it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I understand equally well, that a word from her father in any suitor’s\n",
      "favour, would outweigh herself and all the world. For which reason,\n",
      "Doctor Manette,” said Darnay, modestly but firmly, “I would not ask that\n",
      "word, to save my life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am sure of it. Charles Darnay, mysteries arise out of close love, as\n",
      "well as out of wide division; in the former case, they are subtle and\n",
      "delicate, and difficult to penetrate. My daughter Lucie is, in this one\n",
      "respect, such a mystery to me; I can make no guess at the state of her\n",
      "heart.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“May I ask, sir, if you think she is--” As he hesitated, her father\n",
      "supplied the rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is sought by any other suitor?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is what I meant to say.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her father considered a little before he answered:\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have seen Mr. Carton here, yourself. Mr. Stryver is here too,\n",
      "occasionally. If it be at all, it can only be by one of these.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Or both,” said Darnay.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I had not thought of both; I should not think either, likely. You want\n",
      "a promise from me. Tell me what it is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is, that if Miss Manette should bring to you at any time, on her own\n",
      "part, such a confidence as I have ventured to lay before you, you will\n",
      "bear testimony to what I have said, and to your belief in it. I hope you\n",
      "may be able to think so well of me, as to urge no influence against\n",
      "me. I say nothing more of my stake in this; this is what I ask. The\n",
      "condition on which I ask it, and which you have an undoubted right to\n",
      "require, I will observe immediately.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I give the promise,” said the Doctor, “without any condition. I believe\n",
      "your object to be, purely and truthfully, as you have stated it. I\n",
      "believe your intention is to perpetuate, and not to weaken, the ties\n",
      "between me and my other and far dearer self. If she should ever tell me\n",
      "that you are essential to her perfect happiness, I will give her to you.\n",
      "If there were--Charles Darnay, if there were--”\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man had taken his hand gratefully; their hands were joined as\n",
      "the Doctor spoke:\n",
      "\n",
      "“--any fancies, any reasons, any apprehensions, anything whatsoever,\n",
      "new or old, against the man she really loved--the direct responsibility\n",
      "thereof not lying on his head--they should all be obliterated for her\n",
      "sake. She is everything to me; more to me than suffering, more to me\n",
      "than wrong, more to me--Well! This is idle talk.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So strange was the way in which he faded into silence, and so strange\n",

      "of the Soho horizon. So, he pushed open the door with the weak rattle\n",

      "cashiers, and shouldered himself into the musty back closet where Mr.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Now understand me,” pursued Mr. Lorry. “As a man of business, I am\n",
      "not justified in saying anything about this matter, for, as a man of\n",
      "business, I know nothing of it. But, as an old fellow, who has carried\n",
      "Miss Manette in his arms, who is the trusted friend of Miss Manette and\n",
      "of her father too, and who has a great affection for them both, I have\n",
      "spoken. The confidence is not of my seeking, recollect. Now, you think I\n",
      "may not be right?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not I!” said Stryver, whistling. “I can’t undertake to find third\n",
      "parties in common sense; I can only find it for myself. I suppose sense\n",
      "in certain quarters; you suppose mincing bread-and-butter nonsense. It’s\n",
      "new to me, but you are right, I dare say.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What I suppose, Mr. Stryver, I claim to characterise for myself--And\n",
      "understand me, sir,” said Mr. Lorry, quickly flushing again, “I\n",
      "will not--not even at Tellson’s--have it characterised for me by any\n",
      "gentleman breathing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There! I beg your pardon!” said Stryver.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Granted. Thank you. Well, Mr. Stryver, I was about to say:--it might be\n",
      "painful to you to find yourself mistaken, it might be painful to Doctor\n",
      "Manette to have the task of being explicit with you, it might be very\n",
      "painful to Miss Manette to have the task of being explicit with you. You\n",
      "know the terms upon which I have the honour and happiness to stand with\n",
      "the family. If you please, committing you in no way, representing you\n",
      "in no way, I will undertake to correct my advice by the exercise of a\n",
      "little new observation and judgment expressly brought to bear upon\n",
      "it. If you should then be dissatisfied with it, you can but test its\n",
      "soundness for yourself; if, on the other hand, you should be satisfied\n",
      "with it, and it should be what it now is, it may spare all sides what is\n",
      "best spared. What do you say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How long would you keep me in town?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! It is only a question of a few hours. I could go to Soho in the\n",
      "evening, and come to your chambers afterwards.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then I say yes,” said Stryver: “I won’t go up there now, I am not so\n",
      "hot upon it as that comes to; I say yes, and I shall expect you to look\n",
      "in to-night. Good morning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Mr. Stryver turned and burst out of the Bank, causing such a\n",
      "concussion of air on his passage through, that to stand up against it\n",
      "bowing behind the two counters, required the utmost remaining strength\n",
      "of the two ancient clerks. Those venerable and feeble persons were\n",
      "always seen by the public in the act of bowing, and were popularly\n",
      "believed, when they had bowed a customer out, still to keep on bowing in\n",
      "the empty office until they bowed another customer in.\n",
      "\n",
      "The barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have\n",
      "gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground than\n",
      "moral certainty. Unprepared as he was for the large pill he had to\n",
      "swallow, he got it down. “And now,” said Mr. Stryver, shaking his\n",
      "forensic forefinger at the Temple in general, when it was down, “my way\n",
      "out of this, is, to put you all in the wrong.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a bit of the art of an Old Bailey tactician, in which he found\n",
      "great relief. “You shall not put me in the wrong, young lady,” said Mr.\n",
      "Stryver; “I’ll do that for you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly, when Mr. Lorry called that night as late as ten o’clock,\n",
      "Mr. Stryver, among a quantity of books and papers littered out for the\n",
      "purpose, seemed to have nothing less on his mind than the subject of\n",
      "the morning. He even showed surprise when he saw Mr. Lorry, and was\n",
      "altogether in an absent and preoccupied state.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well!” said that good-natured emissary, after a full half-hour of\n",
      "bootless attempts to bring him round to the question. “I have been to\n",
      "Soho.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To Soho?” repeated Mr. Stryver, coldly. “Oh, to be sure! What am I\n",
      "thinking of!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And I have no doubt,” said Mr. Lorry, “that I was right in the\n",
      "conversation we had. My opinion is confirmed, and I reiterate my\n",
      "advice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I assure you,” returned Mr. Stryver, in the friendliest way, “that I\n",
      "am sorry for it on your account, and sorry for it on the poor father’s\n",
      "account. I know this must always be a sore subject with the family; let\n",
      "us say no more about it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t understand you,” said Mr. Lorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I dare say not,” rejoined Stryver, nodding his head in a smoothing and\n",
      "final way; “no matter, no matter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But it does matter,” Mr. Lorry urged.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No it doesn’t; I assure you it doesn’t. Having supposed that there was\n",
      "sense where there is no sense, and a laudable ambition where there is\n",
      "not a laudable ambition, I am well out of my mistake, and no harm is\n",
      "done. Young women have committed similar follies often before, and have\n",
      "repented them in poverty and obscurity often before. In an unselfish\n",
      "aspect, I am sorry that the thing is dropped, because it would have been\n",
      "a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view; in a selfish aspect, I am\n",
      "glad that the thing has dropped, because it would have been a bad thing\n",
      "for me in a worldly point of view--it is hardly necessary to say I could\n",
      "have gained nothing by it. There is no harm at all done. I have not\n",
      "proposed to the young lady, and, between ourselves, I am by no means\n",
      "certain, on reflection, that I ever should have committed myself to\n",
      "that extent. Mr. Lorry, you cannot control the mincing vanities and\n",
      "giddinesses of empty-headed girls; you must not expect to do it, or you\n",
      "will always be disappointed. Now, pray say no more about it. I tell you,\n",
      "I regret it on account of others, but I am satisfied on my own account.\n",
      "And I am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to sound you,\n",
      "and for giving me your advice; you know the young lady better than I do;\n",
      "you were right, it never would have done.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry was so taken aback, that he looked quite stupidly at Mr.\n",

      "If Sydney Carton ever shone anywhere, he certainly never shone in the\n",
      "house of Doctor Manette. He had been there often, during a whole year,\n",
      "and had always been the same moody and morose lounger there. When he\n",
      "cared to talk, he talked well; but, the cloud of caring for nothing,\n",
      "which overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness, was very rarely\n",
      "pierced by the light within him.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet he did care something for the streets that environed that house,\n",
      "and for the senseless stones that made their pavements. Many a night\n",
      "he vaguely and unhappily wandered there, when wine had brought no\n",
      "transitory gladness to him; many a dreary daybreak revealed his solitary\n",
      "figure lingering there, and still lingering there when the first beams\n",
      "of the sun brought into strong relief, removed beauties of architecture\n",
      "in spires of churches and lofty buildings, as perhaps the quiet time\n",
      "brought some sense of better things, else forgotten and unattainable,\n",
      "into his mind. Of late, the neglected bed in the Temple Court had known\n",
      "him more scantily than ever; and often when he had thrown himself upon\n",
      "it no longer than a few minutes, he had got up again, and haunted that\n",
      "neighbourhood.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a day in August, when Mr. Stryver (after notifying to his jackal\n",
      "that “he had thought better of that marrying matter”) had carried his\n",
      "delicacy into Devonshire, and when the sight and scent of flowers in the\n",
      "City streets had some waifs of goodness in them for the worst, of health\n",
      "for the sickliest, and of youth for the oldest, Sydney’s feet still trod\n",
      "those stones. From being irresolute and purposeless, his feet became\n",
      "animated by an intention, and, in the working out of that intention,\n",
      "they took him to the Doctor’s door.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was shown up-stairs, and found Lucie at her work, alone. She had\n",
      "never been quite at her ease with him, and received him with some little\n",
      "embarrassment as he seated himself near her table. But, looking up at\n",
      "his face in the interchange of the first few common-places, she observed\n",

      "He leaned an elbow on her table, and covered his eyes with his hand. The\n",

      "\n",
      "She had never seen him softened, and was much distressed. He knew her to\n",

      "but not being a poet, mused as little as possible, and looked about him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It fell out that he was thus engaged in a season when crowds were\n",
      "few, and belated women few, and when his affairs in general were so\n",
      "unprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that Mrs.\n",
      "Cruncher must have been “flopping” in some pointed manner, when an\n",
      "unusual concourse pouring down Fleet-street westward, attracted his\n",
      "attention. Looking that way, Mr. Cruncher made out that some kind of\n",
      "funeral was coming along, and that there was popular objection to this\n",
      "funeral, which engendered uproar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Young Jerry,” said Mr. Cruncher, turning to his offspring, “it’s a\n",
      "buryin’.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hooroar, father!” cried Young Jerry.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious\n",
      "significance. The elder gentleman took the cry so ill, that he watched\n",
      "his opportunity, and smote the young gentleman on the ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What d’ye mean? What are you hooroaring at? What do you want to conwey\n",
      "to your own father, you young Rip? This boy is a getting too many for\n",
      "_me_!” said Mr. Cruncher, surveying him. “Him and his hooroars! Don’t\n",
      "let me hear no more of you, or you shall feel some more of me. D’ye\n",
      "hear?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I warn’t doing no harm,” Young Jerry protested, rubbing his cheek.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Drop it then,” said Mr. Cruncher; “I won’t have none of _your_ no\n",
      "harms. Get a top of that there seat, and look at the crowd.”\n",
      "\n",
      "His son obeyed, and the crowd approached; they were bawling and hissing\n",
      "round a dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach, in which mourning coach\n",
      "there was only one mourner, dressed in the dingy trappings that were\n",
      "considered essential to the dignity of the position. The position\n",
      "appeared by no means to please him, however, with an increasing rabble\n",
      "surrounding the coach, deriding him, making grimaces at him, and\n",
      "incessantly groaning and calling out: “Yah! Spies! Tst! Yaha! Spies!”\n",
      " with many compliments too numerous and forcible to repeat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Funerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for Mr. Cruncher; he\n",
      "always pricked up his senses, and became excited, when a funeral passed\n",
      "Tellson’s. Naturally, therefore, a funeral with this uncommon attendance\n",
      "excited him greatly, and he asked of the first man who ran against him:\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is it, brother? What’s it about?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ don’t know,” said the man. “Spies! Yaha! Tst! Spies!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He asked another man. “Who is it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ don’t know,” returned the man, clapping his hands to his mouth\n",
      "nevertheless, and vociferating in a surprising heat and with the\n",
      "greatest ardour, “Spies! Yaha! Tst, tst! Spi--ies!”\n",
      "\n",
      "At length, a person better informed on the merits of the case, tumbled\n",
      "against him, and from this person he learned that the funeral was the\n",
      "funeral of one Roger Cly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Was he a spy?” asked Mr. Cruncher.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Old Bailey spy,” returned his informant. “Yaha! Tst! Yah! Old Bailey\n",
      "Spi--i--ies!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, to be sure!” exclaimed Jerry, recalling the Trial at which he had\n",
      "assisted. “I’ve seen him. Dead, is he?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dead as mutton,” returned the other, “and can’t be too dead. Have ’em\n",
      "out, there! Spies! Pull ’em out, there! Spies!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea,\n",
      "that the crowd caught it up with eagerness, and loudly repeating the\n",
      "suggestion to have ’em out, and to pull ’em out, mobbed the two vehicles\n",
      "so closely that they came to a stop. On the crowd’s opening the coach\n",
      "doors, the one mourner scuffled out by himself and was in their hands\n",
      "for a moment; but he was so alert, and made such good use of his time,\n",
      "that in another moment he was scouring away up a bye-street, after\n",
      "shedding his cloak, hat, long hatband, white pocket-handkerchief, and\n",
      "other symbolical tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "These, the people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide with great\n",
      "enjoyment, while the tradesmen hurriedly shut up their shops; for a\n",
      "crowd in those times stopped at nothing, and was a monster much dreaded.\n",
      "They had already got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin\n",
      "out, when some brighter genius proposed instead, its being escorted to\n",
      "its destination amidst general rejoicing. Practical suggestions being\n",
      "much needed, this suggestion, too, was received with acclamation, and\n",
      "the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out,\n",
      "while as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any\n",
      "exercise of ingenuity stick upon it. Among the first of these volunteers\n",
      "was Jerry Cruncher himself, who modestly concealed his spiky head from\n",
      "the observation of Tellson’s, in the further corner of the mourning\n",
      "coach.\n",
      "\n",
      "The officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes in\n",
      "the ceremonies; but, the river being alarmingly near, and several voices\n",
      "remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory\n",
      "members of the profession to reason, the protest was faint and brief.\n",
      "The remodelled procession started, with a chimney-sweep driving the\n",
      "hearse--advised by the regular driver, who was perched beside him, under\n",
      "close inspection, for the purpose--and with a pieman, also attended\n",
      "by his cabinet minister, driving the mourning coach. A bear-leader, a\n",
      "popular street character of the time, was impressed as an additional\n",
      "ornament, before the cavalcade had gone far down the Strand; and his\n",
      "bear, who was black and very mangy, gave quite an Undertaking air to\n",
      "that part of the procession in which he walked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, with beer-drinking, pipe-smoking, song-roaring, and infinite\n",
      "caricaturing of woe, the disorderly procession went its way, recruiting\n",
      "at every step, and all the shops shutting up before it. Its destination\n",
      "was the old church of Saint Pancras, far off in the fields. It got there\n",
      "in course of time; insisted on pouring into the burial-ground; finally,\n",
      "accomplished the interment of the deceased Roger Cly in its own way, and\n",
      "highly to its own satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dead man disposed of, and the crowd being under the necessity of\n",
      "providing some other entertainment for itself, another brighter\n",
      "genius (or perhaps the same) conceived the humour of impeaching casual\n",
      "passers-by, as Old Bailey spies, and wreaking vengeance on them. Chase\n",
      "was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been near\n",
      "the Old Bailey in their lives, in the realisation of this fancy, and\n",
      "they were roughly hustled and maltreated. The transition to the sport of\n",
      "window-breaking, and thence to the plundering of public-houses, was easy\n",
      "and natural. At last, after several hours, when sundry summer-houses had\n",
      "been pulled down, and some area-railings had been torn up, to arm\n",
      "the more belligerent spirits, a rumour got about that the Guards were\n",
      "coming. Before this rumour, the crowd gradually melted away, and perhaps\n",
      "the Guards came, and perhaps they never came, and this was the usual\n",
      "progress of a mob.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher did not assist at the closing sports, but had remained\n",
      "behind in the churchyard, to confer and condole with the undertakers.\n",
      "The place had a soothing influence on him. He procured a pipe from a\n",
      "neighbouring public-house, and smoked it, looking in at the railings and\n",
      "maturely considering the spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jerry,” said Mr. Cruncher, apostrophising himself in his usual way,\n",
      "“you see that there Cly that day, and you see with your own eyes that he\n",
      "was a young ’un and a straight made ’un.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Having smoked his pipe out, and ruminated a little longer, he turned\n",
      "himself about, that he might appear, before the hour of closing, on his\n",
      "station at Tellson’s. Whether his meditations on mortality had touched\n",
      "his liver, or whether his general health had been previously at all\n",
      "amiss, or whether he desired to show a little attention to an eminent\n",
      "man, is not so much to the purpose, as that he made a short call upon\n",
      "his medical adviser--a distinguished surgeon--on his way back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Young Jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest, and reported No\n",
      "job in his absence. The bank closed, the ancient clerks came out, the\n",
      "usual watch was set, and Mr. Cruncher and his son went home to tea.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, I tell you where it is!” said Mr. Cruncher to his wife, on\n",
      "entering. “If, as a honest tradesman, my wenturs goes wrong to-night, I\n",
      "shall make sure that you’ve been praying again me, and I shall work you\n",
      "for it just the same as if I seen you do it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The dejected Mrs. Cruncher shook her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, you’re at it afore my face!” said Mr. Cruncher, with signs of\n",
      "angry apprehension.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am saying nothing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, then; don’t meditate nothing. You might as well flop as meditate.\n",
      "You may as well go again me one way as another. Drop it altogether.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Jerry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Jerry,” repeated Mr. Cruncher sitting down to tea. “Ah! It _is_\n",
      "yes, Jerry. That’s about it. You may say yes, Jerry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corroborations,\n",
      "but made use of them, as people not unfrequently do, to express general\n",
      "ironical dissatisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You and your yes, Jerry,” said Mr. Cruncher, taking a bite out of his\n",
      "bread-and-butter, and seeming to help it down with a large invisible\n",
      "oyster out of his saucer. “Ah! I think so. I believe you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are going out to-night?” asked his decent wife, when he took\n",
      "another bite.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I am.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“May I go with you, father?” asked his son, briskly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, you mayn’t. I’m a going--as your mother knows--a fishing. That’s\n",
      "where I’m going to. Going a fishing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your fishing-rod gets rayther rusty; don’t it, father?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never you mind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shall you bring any fish home, father?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I don’t, you’ll have short commons, to-morrow,” returned that\n",
      "gentleman, shaking his head; “that’s questions enough for you; I ain’t a\n",
      "going out, till you’ve been long abed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping a\n",
      "most vigilant watch on Mrs. Cruncher, and sullenly holding her in\n",
      "conversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions\n",
      "to his disadvantage. With this view, he urged his son to hold her in\n",
      "conversation also, and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling\n",
      "on any causes of complaint he could bring against her, rather than\n",
      "he would leave her for a moment to her own reflections. The devoutest\n",
      "person could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacy of an\n",
      "honest prayer than he did in this distrust of his wife. It was as if a\n",
      "professed unbeliever in ghosts should be frightened by a ghost story.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And mind you!” said Mr. Cruncher. “No games to-morrow! If I, as a\n",
      "honest tradesman, succeed in providing a jinte of meat or two, none\n",
      "of your not touching of it, and sticking to bread. If I, as a honest\n",
      "tradesman, am able to provide a little beer, none of your declaring\n",
      "on water. When you go to Rome, do as Rome does. Rome will be a ugly\n",
      "customer to you, if you don’t. _I_’m your Rome, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he began grumbling again:\n",
      "\n",
      "“With your flying into the face of your own wittles and drink! I don’t\n",
      "know how scarce you mayn’t make the wittles and drink here, by your\n",
      "flopping tricks and your unfeeling conduct. Look at your boy: he _is_\n",
      "your’n, ain’t he? He’s as thin as a lath. Do you call yourself a mother,\n",
      "and not know that a mother’s first duty is to blow her boy out?”\n",
      "\n",
      "This touched Young Jerry on a tender place; who adjured his mother to\n",
      "perform her first duty, and, whatever else she did or neglected, above\n",
      "all things to lay especial stress on the discharge of that maternal\n",
      "function so affectingly and delicately indicated by his other parent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus the evening wore away with the Cruncher family, until Young Jerry\n",
      "was ordered to bed, and his mother, laid under similar injunctions,\n",
      "obeyed them. Mr. Cruncher beguiled the earlier watches of the night with\n",
      "solitary pipes, and did not start upon his excursion until nearly one\n",
      "o’clock. Towards that small and ghostly hour, he rose up from his chair,\n",
      "took a key out of his pocket, opened a locked cupboard, and brought\n",
      "forth a sack, a crowbar of convenient size, a rope and chain, and other\n",
      "fishing tackle of that nature. Disposing these articles about him\n",
      "in skilful manner, he bestowed a parting defiance on Mrs. Cruncher,\n",
      "extinguished the light, and went out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Young Jerry, who had only made a feint of undressing when he went to\n",
      "bed, was not long after his father. Under cover of the darkness he\n",
      "followed out of the room, followed down the stairs, followed down the\n",
      "court, followed out into the streets. He was in no uneasiness concerning\n",
      "his getting into the house again, for it was full of lodgers, and the\n",
      "door stood ajar all night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Impelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his\n",
      "father’s honest calling, Young Jerry, keeping as close to house fronts,\n",
      "walls, and doorways, as his eyes were close to one another, held his\n",
      "honoured parent in view. The honoured parent steering Northward, had not\n",
      "gone far, when he was joined by another disciple of Izaak Walton, and\n",
      "the two trudged on together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within half an hour from the first starting, they were beyond the\n",
      "winking lamps, and the more than winking watchmen, and were out upon a\n",
      "lonely road. Another fisherman was picked up here--and that so silently,\n",
      "that if Young Jerry had been superstitious, he might have supposed the\n",
      "second follower of the gentle craft to have, all of a sudden, split\n",
      "himself into two.\n",
      "\n",
      "The three went on, and Young Jerry went on, until the three stopped\n",
      "under a bank overhanging the road. Upon the top of the bank was a low\n",
      "brick wall, surmounted by an iron railing. In the shadow of bank and\n",
      "wall the three turned out of the road, and up a blind lane, of which\n",
      "the wall--there, risen to some eight or ten feet high--formed one side.\n",
      "Crouching down in a corner, peeping up the lane, the next object that\n",
      "Young Jerry saw, was the form of his honoured parent, pretty well\n",
      "defined against a watery and clouded moon, nimbly scaling an iron gate.\n",
      "He was soon over, and then the second fisherman got over, and then the\n",
      "third. They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate, and lay\n",
      "there a little--listening perhaps. Then, they moved away on their hands\n",
      "and knees.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was now Young Jerry’s turn to approach the gate: which he did,\n",
      "holding his breath. Crouching down again in a corner there, and looking\n",
      "in, he made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank grass!\n",
      "and all the gravestones in the churchyard--it was a large churchyard\n",
      "that they were in--looking on like ghosts in white, while the church\n",
      "tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant. They did not\n",
      "creep far, before they stopped and stood upright. And then they began to\n",
      "fish.\n",
      "\n",
      "They fished with a spade, at first. Presently the honoured parent\n",
      "appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew.\n",
      "Whatever tools they worked with, they worked hard, until the awful\n",
      "striking of the church clock so terrified Young Jerry, that he made off,\n",
      "with his hair as stiff as his father’s.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, his long-cherished desire to know more about these matters, not\n",
      "only stopped him in his running away, but lured him back again. They\n",
      "were still fishing perseveringly, when he peeped in at the gate for\n",
      "the second time; but, now they seemed to have got a bite. There was a\n",
      "screwing and complaining sound down below, and their bent figures were\n",
      "strained, as if by a weight. By slow degrees the weight broke away the\n",
      "earth upon it, and came to the surface. Young Jerry very well knew what\n",
      "it would be; but, when he saw it, and saw his honoured parent about to\n",
      "wrench it open, he was so frightened, being new to the sight, that he\n",
      "made off again, and never stopped until he had run a mile or more.\n",
      "\n",
      "He would not have stopped then, for anything less necessary than breath,\n",
      "it being a spectral sort of race that he ran, and one highly desirable\n",
      "to get to the end of. He had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen\n",
      "was running after him; and, pictured as hopping on behind him, bolt\n",
      "upright, upon its narrow end, always on the point of overtaking him\n",
      "and hopping on at his side--perhaps taking his arm--it was a pursuer to\n",
      "shun. It was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too, for, while it\n",
      "was making the whole night behind him dreadful, he darted out into the\n",
      "roadway to avoid dark alleys, fearful of its coming hopping out of them\n",
      "like a dropsical boy’s kite without tail and wings. It hid in doorways\n",
      "too, rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors, and drawing them up\n",
      "to its ears, as if it were laughing. It got into shadows on the road,\n",
      "and lay cunningly on its back to trip him up. All this time it was\n",
      "incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him, so that when the boy\n",
      "got to his own door he had reason for being half dead. And even then\n",
      "it would not leave him, but followed him upstairs with a bump on every\n",
      "stair, scrambled into bed with him, and bumped down, dead and heavy, on\n",
      "his breast when he fell asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "From his oppressed slumber, Young Jerry in his closet was awakened after\n",
      "daybreak and before sunrise, by the presence of his father in the\n",
      "family room. Something had gone wrong with him; at least, so Young Jerry\n",
      "inferred, from the circumstance of his holding Mrs. Cruncher by the\n",
      "ears, and knocking the back of her head against the head-board of the\n",
      "bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I told you I would,” said Mr. Cruncher, “and I did.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jerry, Jerry, Jerry!” his wife implored.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You oppose yourself to the profit of the business,” said Jerry, “and me\n",

      "you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I try to be a good wife, Jerry,” the poor woman protested, with tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it being a good wife to oppose your husband’s business? Is it\n",
      "honouring your husband to dishonour his business? Is it obeying your\n",
      "husband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You hadn’t taken to the dreadful business then, Jerry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s enough for you,” retorted Mr. Cruncher, “to be the wife of a\n",
      "honest tradesman, and not to occupy your female mind with calculations\n",
      "when he took to his trade or when he didn’t. A honouring and obeying\n",
      "wife would let his trade alone altogether. Call yourself a religious\n",
      "woman? If you’re a religious woman, give me a irreligious one! You have\n",
      "no more nat’ral sense of duty than the bed of this here Thames river has\n",
      "of a pile, and similarly it must be knocked into you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice, and terminated in\n",
      "the honest tradesman’s kicking off his clay-soiled boots, and lying down\n",
      "at his length on the floor. After taking a timid peep at him lying on\n",
      "his back, with his rusty hands under his head for a pillow, his son lay\n",
      "down too, and fell asleep again.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no fish for breakfast, and not much of anything else. Mr.\n",
      "Cruncher was out of spirits, and out of temper, and kept an iron pot-lid\n",
      "by him as a projectile for the correction of Mrs. Cruncher, in case\n",
      "he should observe any symptoms of her saying Grace. He was brushed\n",
      "and washed at the usual hour, and set off with his son to pursue his\n",

      "Young Jerry, walking with the stool under his arm at his father’s side\n",
      "along sunny and crowded Fleet-street, was a very different Young Jerry\n",
      "from him of the previous night, running home through darkness and\n",
      "solitude from his grim pursuer. His cunning was fresh with the day,\n",
      "and his qualms were gone with the night--in which particulars it is not\n",
      "improbable that he had compeers in Fleet-street and the City of London,\n",
      "that fine morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Father,” said Young Jerry, as they walked along: taking care to keep\n",
      "at arm’s length and to have the stool well between them: “what’s a\n",
      "Resurrection-Man?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he answered, “How\n",
      "should I know?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought you knowed everything, father,” said the artless boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hem! Well,” returned Mr. Cruncher, going on again, and lifting off his\n",
      "hat to give his spikes free play, “he’s a tradesman.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What’s his goods, father?” asked the brisk Young Jerry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“His goods,” said Mr. Cruncher, after turning it over in his mind, “is a\n",
      "branch of Scientific goods.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Persons’ bodies, ain’t it, father?” asked the lively boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I believe it is something of that sort,” said Mr. Cruncher.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, father, I should so like to be a Resurrection-Man when I’m quite\n",
      "growed up!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher was soothed, but shook his head in a dubious and moral way.\n",
      "“It depends upon how you dewelop your talents. Be careful to dewelop\n",
      "your talents, and never to say no more than you can help to nobody, and\n",
      "there’s no telling at the present time what you may not come to be fit\n",
      "for.” As Young Jerry, thus encouraged, went on a few yards in advance,\n",
      "to plant the stool in the shadow of the Bar, Mr. Cruncher added to\n",
      "himself: “Jerry, you honest tradesman, there’s hopes wot that boy will\n",
      "yet be a blessing to you, and a recompense to you for his mother!”\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine-shop of Monsieur\n",
      "Defarge. As early as six o’clock in the morning, sallow faces peeping\n",
      "through its barred windows had descried other faces within, bending over\n",
      "measures of wine. Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin wine at the best\n",
      "of times, but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that\n",
      "he sold at this time. A sour wine, moreover, or a souring, for its\n",
      "influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy. No\n",
      "vivacious Bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of Monsieur\n",
      "Defarge: but, a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark, lay hidden in\n",
      "the dregs of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "This had been the third morning in succession, on which there had been\n",
      "early drinking at the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. It had begun\n",
      "on Monday, and here was Wednesday come. There had been more of early\n",
      "brooding than drinking; for, many men had listened and whispered and\n",
      "slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door, who could\n",
      "not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls. These\n",
      "were to the full as interested in the place, however, as if they could\n",
      "have commanded whole barrels of wine; and they glided from seat to seat,\n",
      "and from corner to corner, swallowing talk in lieu of drink, with greedy\n",
      "looks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notwithstanding an unusual flow of company, the master of the wine-shop\n",
      "was not visible. He was not missed; for, nobody who crossed the\n",
      "threshold looked for him, nobody asked for him, nobody wondered to see\n",
      "only Madame Defarge in her seat, presiding over the distribution of\n",
      "wine, with a bowl of battered small coins before her, as much defaced\n",
      "and beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of\n",
      "humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come.\n",
      "\n",
      "A suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind, were perhaps\n",
      "observed by the spies who looked in at the wine-shop, as they looked in\n",
      "at every place, high and low, from the king’s palace to the criminal’s\n",
      "gaol. Games at cards languished, players at dominoes musingly built\n",
      "towers with them, drinkers drew figures on the tables with spilt drops\n",
      "of wine, Madame Defarge herself picked out the pattern on her sleeve\n",
      "with her toothpick, and saw and heard something inaudible and invisible\n",
      "a long way off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, Saint Antoine in this vinous feature of his, until midday. It was\n",
      "high noontide, when two dusty men passed through his streets and under\n",
      "his swinging lamps: of whom, one was Monsieur Defarge: the other a\n",
      "mender of roads in a blue cap. All adust and athirst, the two entered\n",
      "the wine-shop. Their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in the breast\n",
      "of Saint Antoine, fast spreading as they came along, which stirred and\n",
      "flickered in flames of faces at most doors and windows. Yet, no one had\n",
      "followed them, and no man spoke when they entered the wine-shop, though\n",
      "the eyes of every man there were turned upon them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good day, gentlemen!” said Monsieur Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue. It elicited\n",
      "an answering chorus of “Good day!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is bad weather, gentlemen,” said Defarge, shaking his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon which, every man looked at his neighbour, and then all cast down\n",
      "their eyes and sat silent. Except one man, who got up and went out.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My wife,” said Defarge aloud, addressing Madame Defarge: “I have\n",
      "travelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads, called\n",
      "Jacques. I met him--by accident--a day and half’s journey out of Paris.\n",
      "He is a good child, this mender of roads, called Jacques. Give him to\n",
      "drink, my wife!”\n",
      "\n",
      "A second man got up and went out. Madame Defarge set wine before the\n",
      "mender of roads called Jacques, who doffed his blue cap to the company,\n",
      "and drank. In the breast of his blouse he carried some coarse dark\n",
      "bread; he ate of this between whiles, and sat munching and drinking near\n",
      "Madame Defarge’s counter. A third man got up and went out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Defarge refreshed himself with a draught of wine--but, he took less\n",
      "than was given to the stranger, as being himself a man to whom it was no\n",
      "rarity--and stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast.\n",
      "He looked at no one present, and no one now looked at him; not even\n",
      "Madame Defarge, who had taken up her knitting, and was at work.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you finished your repast, friend?” he asked, in due season.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, thank you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, then! You shall see the apartment that I told you you could\n",
      "occupy. It will suit you to a marvel.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Out of the wine-shop into the street, out of the street into a\n",
      "courtyard, out of the courtyard up a steep staircase, out of the\n",
      "staircase into a garret--formerly the garret where a white-haired man\n",
      "sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes.\n",
      "\n",
      "No white-haired man was there now; but, the three men were there who had\n",
      "gone out of the wine-shop singly. And between them and the white-haired\n",
      "man afar off, was the one small link, that they had once looked in at\n",
      "him through the chinks in the wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Defarge closed the door carefully, and spoke in a subdued voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques Three! This is the witness\n",
      "encountered by appointment, by me, Jacques Four. He will tell you all.\n",
      "Speak, Jacques Five!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The mender of roads, blue cap in hand, wiped his swarthy forehead with\n",
      "it, and said, “Where shall I commence, monsieur?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Commence,” was Monsieur Defarge’s not unreasonable reply, “at the\n",
      "commencement.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I saw him then, messieurs,” began the mender of roads, “a year ago this\n",
      "running summer, underneath the carriage of the Marquis, hanging by the\n",
      "chain. Behold the manner of it. I leaving my work on the road, the sun\n",
      "going to bed, the carriage of the Marquis slowly ascending the hill, he\n",
      "hanging by the chain--like this.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Again the mender of roads went through the whole performance; in which\n",
      "he ought to have been perfect by that time, seeing that it had been\n",
      "the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village\n",
      "during a whole year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jacques One struck in, and asked if he had ever seen the man before?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never,” answered the mender of roads, recovering his perpendicular.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jacques Three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then?\n",
      "\n",
      "“By his tall figure,” said the mender of roads, softly, and with his\n",
      "finger at his nose. “When Monsieur the Marquis demands that evening,\n",
      "‘Say, what is he like?’ I make response, ‘Tall as a spectre.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You should have said, short as a dwarf,” returned Jacques Two.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But what did I know? The deed was not then accomplished, neither did he\n",
      "confide in me. Observe! Under those circumstances even, I do not\n",
      "offer my testimony. Monsieur the Marquis indicates me with his finger,\n",
      "standing near our little fountain, and says, ‘To me! Bring that rascal!’\n",
      "My faith, messieurs, I offer nothing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is right there, Jacques,” murmured Defarge, to him who had\n",
      "interrupted. “Go on!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good!” said the mender of roads, with an air of mystery. “The tall man\n",
      "is lost, and he is sought--how many months? Nine, ten, eleven?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No matter, the number,” said Defarge. “He is well hidden, but at last\n",
      "he is unluckily found. Go on!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am again at work upon the hill-side, and the sun is again about to\n",
      "go to bed. I am collecting my tools to descend to my cottage down in the\n",
      "village below, where it is already dark, when I raise my eyes, and see\n",
      "coming over the hill six soldiers. In the midst of them is a tall man\n",
      "with his arms bound--tied to his sides--like this!”\n",
      "\n",
      "With the aid of his indispensable cap, he represented a man with his\n",
      "elbows bound fast at his hips, with cords that were knotted behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I stand aside, messieurs, by my heap of stones, to see the soldiers\n",
      "and their prisoner pass (for it is a solitary road, that, where any\n",
      "spectacle is well worth looking at), and at first, as they approach, I\n",
      "see no more than that they are six soldiers with a tall man bound, and\n",
      "that they are almost black to my sight--except on the side of the sun\n",
      "going to bed, where they have a red edge, messieurs. Also, I see that\n",
      "their long shadows are on the hollow ridge on the opposite side of the\n",
      "road, and are on the hill above it, and are like the shadows of giants.\n",
      "Also, I see that they are covered with dust, and that the dust moves\n",
      "with them as they come, tramp, tramp! But when they advance quite near\n",
      "to me, I recognise the tall man, and he recognises me. Ah, but he would\n",
      "be well content to precipitate himself over the hill-side once again, as\n",
      "on the evening when he and I first encountered, close to the same spot!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He described it as if he were there, and it was evident that he saw it\n",
      "vividly; perhaps he had not seen much in his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not show the soldiers that I recognise the tall man; he does not\n",
      "show the soldiers that he recognises me; we do it, and we know it, with\n",
      "our eyes. ‘Come on!’ says the chief of that company, pointing to the\n",
      "village, ‘bring him fast to his tomb!’ and they bring him faster. I\n",
      "follow. His arms are swelled because of being bound so tight, his wooden\n",
      "shoes are large and clumsy, and he is lame. Because he is lame, and\n",
      "consequently slow, they drive him with their guns--like this!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He imitated the action of a man’s being impelled forward by the\n",
      "butt-ends of muskets.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As they descend the hill like madmen running a race, he falls. They\n",
      "laugh and pick him up again. His face is bleeding and covered with dust,\n",
      "but he cannot touch it; thereupon they laugh again. They bring him into\n",
      "the village; all the village runs to look; they take him past the mill,\n",
      "and up to the prison; all the village sees the prison gate open in the\n",
      "darkness of the night, and swallow him--like this!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He opened his mouth as wide as he could, and shut it with a sounding\n",
      "snap of his teeth. Observant of his unwillingness to mar the effect by\n",
      "opening it again, Defarge said, “Go on, Jacques.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All the village,” pursued the mender of roads, on tiptoe and in a low\n",
      "voice, “withdraws; all the village whispers by the fountain; all the\n",
      "village sleeps; all the village dreams of that unhappy one, within the\n",
      "locks and bars of the prison on the crag, and never to come out of it,\n",
      "except to perish. In the morning, with my tools upon my shoulder, eating\n",
      "my morsel of black bread as I go, I make a circuit by the prison, on\n",
      "my way to my work. There I see him, high up, behind the bars of a lofty\n",
      "iron cage, bloody and dusty as last night, looking through. He has no\n",
      "hand free, to wave to me; I dare not call to him; he regards me like a\n",
      "dead man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Defarge and the three glanced darkly at one another. The looks of all\n",
      "of them were dark, repressed, and revengeful, as they listened to the\n",
      "countryman’s story; the manner of all of them, while it was secret, was\n",
      "authoritative too. They had the air of a rough tribunal; Jacques One\n",
      "and Two sitting on the old pallet-bed, each with his chin resting on\n",
      "his hand, and his eyes intent on the road-mender; Jacques Three, equally\n",
      "intent, on one knee behind them, with his agitated hand always gliding\n",
      "over the network of fine nerves about his mouth and nose; Defarge\n",
      "standing between them and the narrator, whom he had stationed in the\n",
      "light of the window, by turns looking from him to them, and from them to\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go on, Jacques,” said Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He remains up there in his iron cage some days. The village looks\n",
      "at him by stealth, for it is afraid. But it always looks up, from a\n",
      "distance, at the prison on the crag; and in the evening, when the work\n",
      "of the day is achieved and it assembles to gossip at the fountain, all\n",
      "faces are turned towards the prison. Formerly, they were turned towards\n",
      "the posting-house; now, they are turned towards the prison. They\n",
      "whisper at the fountain, that although condemned to death he will not be\n",
      "executed; they say that petitions have been presented in Paris, showing\n",
      "that he was enraged and made mad by the death of his child; they say\n",
      "that a petition has been presented to the King himself. What do I know?\n",
      "It is possible. Perhaps yes, perhaps no.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Listen then, Jacques,” Number One of that name sternly interposed.\n",
      "“Know that a petition was presented to the King and Queen. All here,\n",
      "yourself excepted, saw the King take it, in his carriage in the street,\n",
      "sitting beside the Queen. It is Defarge whom you see here, who, at the\n",
      "hazard of his life, darted out before the horses, with the petition in\n",
      "his hand.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And once again listen, Jacques!” said the kneeling Number Three:\n",
      "his fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves, with a\n",
      "strikingly greedy air, as if he hungered for something--that was neither\n",
      "food nor drink; “the guard, horse and foot, surrounded the petitioner,\n",
      "and struck him blows. You hear?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hear, messieurs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go on then,” said Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Again; on the other hand, they whisper at the fountain,” resumed the\n",
      "countryman, “that he is brought down into our country to be executed on\n",
      "the spot, and that he will very certainly be executed. They even whisper\n",
      "that because he has slain Monseigneur, and because Monseigneur was the\n",
      "father of his tenants--serfs--what you will--he will be executed as a\n",
      "parricide. One old man says at the fountain, that his right hand, armed\n",
      "with the knife, will be burnt off before his face; that, into wounds\n",
      "which will be made in his arms, his breast, and his legs, there will be\n",
      "poured boiling oil, melted lead, hot resin, wax, and sulphur; finally,\n",
      "that he will be torn limb from limb by four strong horses. That old man\n",
      "says, all this was actually done to a prisoner who made an attempt on\n",
      "the life of the late King, Louis Fifteen. But how do I know if he lies?\n",
      "I am not a scholar.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Listen once again then, Jacques!” said the man with the restless hand\n",
      "and the craving air. “The name of that prisoner was Damiens, and it was\n",
      "all done in open day, in the open streets of this city of Paris; and\n",
      "nothing was more noticed in the vast concourse that saw it done, than\n",
      "the crowd of ladies of quality and fashion, who were full of eager\n",
      "attention to the last--to the last, Jacques, prolonged until nightfall,\n",
      "when he had lost two legs and an arm, and still breathed! And it was\n",
      "done--why, how old are you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thirty-five,” said the mender of roads, who looked sixty.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was done when you were more than ten years old; you might have seen\n",
      "it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Enough!” said Defarge, with grim impatience. “Long live the Devil! Go\n",
      "on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well! Some whisper this, some whisper that; they speak of nothing else;\n",
      "even the fountain appears to fall to that tune. At length, on Sunday\n",
      "night when all the village is asleep, come soldiers, winding down from\n",
      "the prison, and their guns ring on the stones of the little street.\n",
      "Workmen dig, workmen hammer, soldiers laugh and sing; in the morning, by\n",
      "the fountain, there is raised a gallows forty feet high, poisoning the\n",
      "water.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The mender of roads looked _through_ rather than _at_ the low ceiling,\n",
      "and pointed as if he saw the gallows somewhere in the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All work is stopped, all assemble there, nobody leads the cows out,\n",
      "the cows are there with the rest. At midday, the roll of drums. Soldiers\n",
      "have marched into the prison in the night, and he is in the midst\n",
      "of many soldiers. He is bound as before, and in his mouth there is\n",
      "a gag--tied so, with a tight string, making him look almost as if he\n",
      "laughed.” He suggested it, by creasing his face with his two thumbs,\n",
      "from the corners of his mouth to his ears. “On the top of the gallows is\n",
      "fixed the knife, blade upwards, with its point in the air. He is hanged\n",
      "there forty feet high--and is left hanging, poisoning the water.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They looked at one another, as he used his blue cap to wipe his face,\n",
      "on which the perspiration had started afresh while he recalled the\n",
      "spectacle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is frightful, messieurs. How can the women and the children draw\n",
      "water! Who can gossip of an evening, under that shadow! Under it, have\n",
      "I said? When I left the village, Monday evening as the sun was going to\n",
      "bed, and looked back from the hill, the shadow struck across the church,\n",
      "across the mill, across the prison--seemed to strike across the earth,\n",
      "messieurs, to where the sky rests upon it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The hungry man gnawed one of his fingers as he looked at the other\n",
      "three, and his finger quivered with the craving that was on him.\n",

      "\n",

      "him to bring it down one day.”\n",

      "dozing on the topmost stair, was advised to lay himself down on the\n",
      "pallet-bed and take some rest. He needed no persuasion, and was soon\n",
      "asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Worse quarters than Defarge’s wine-shop, could easily have been found\n",
      "in Paris for a provincial slave of that degree. Saving for a mysterious\n",
      "dread of madame by which he was constantly haunted, his life was very\n",
      "new and agreeable. But, madame sat all day at her counter, so expressly\n",
      "unconscious of him, and so particularly determined not to perceive that\n",
      "his being there had any connection with anything below the surface, that\n",
      "he shook in his wooden shoes whenever his eye lighted on her. For, he\n",
      "contended with himself that it was impossible to foresee what that lady\n",
      "might pretend next; and he felt assured that if she should take it\n",
      "into her brightly ornamented head to pretend that she had seen him do a\n",
      "murder and afterwards flay the victim, she would infallibly go through\n",
      "with it until the play was played out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, when Sunday came, the mender of roads was not enchanted\n",
      "(though he said he was) to find that madame was to accompany monsieur\n",
      "and himself to Versailles. It was additionally disconcerting to have\n",
      "madame knitting all the way there, in a public conveyance; it was\n",
      "additionally disconcerting yet, to have madame in the crowd in the\n",
      "afternoon, still with her knitting in her hands as the crowd waited to\n",

      "The man moved a little further away, as soon as he could, and the mender\n",

      "and oppressive. If he needed a King and Queen to restore him, he was\n",
      "fortunate in having his remedy at hand; for, soon the large-faced King\n",
      "and the fair-faced Queen came in their golden coach, attended by the\n",
      "shining Bull’s Eye of their Court, a glittering multitude of laughing\n",
      "ladies and fine lords; and in jewels and silks and powder and splendour\n",
      "and elegantly spurning figures and handsomely disdainful faces of both\n",
      "sexes, the mender of roads bathed himself, so much to his temporary\n",
      "intoxication, that he cried Long live the King, Long live the Queen,\n",
      "Long live everybody and everything! as if he had never heard of\n",
      "ubiquitous Jacques in his time. Then, there were gardens, courtyards,\n",
      "terraces, fountains, green banks, more King and Queen, more Bull’s Eye,\n",
      "more lords and ladies, more Long live they all! until he absolutely wept\n",
      "with sentiment. During the whole of this scene, which lasted some three\n",
      "hours, he had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company,\n",
      "and throughout Defarge held him by the collar, as if to restrain him\n",
      "from flying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to\n",
      "pieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bravo!” said Defarge, clapping him on the back when it was over, like a\n",

      "stop it for ever and ever, in you or in a hundred like you rather than\n",

      "Madame Defarge and monsieur her husband returned amicably to the\n",
      "bosom of Saint Antoine, while a speck in a blue cap toiled through the\n",
      "darkness, and through the dust, and down the weary miles of avenue by\n",
      "the wayside, slowly tending towards that point of the compass where\n",
      "the chateau of Monsieur the Marquis, now in his grave, listened to\n",
      "the whispering trees. Such ample leisure had the stone faces, now,\n",
      "for listening to the trees and to the fountain, that the few village\n",
      "scarecrows who, in their quest for herbs to eat and fragments of dead\n",
      "stick to burn, strayed within sight of the great stone courtyard and\n",
      "terrace staircase, had it borne in upon their starved fancy that\n",
      "the expression of the faces was altered. A rumour just lived in the\n",
      "village--had a faint and bare existence there, as its people had--that\n",
      "when the knife struck home, the faces changed, from faces of pride to\n",
      "faces of anger and pain; also, that when that dangling figure was hauled\n",
      "up forty feet above the fountain, they changed again, and bore a cruel\n",
      "look of being avenged, which they would henceforth bear for ever. In the\n",
      "stone face over the great window of the bed-chamber where the murder\n",
      "was done, two fine dints were pointed out in the sculptured nose, which\n",
      "everybody recognised, and which nobody had seen of old; and on the\n",
      "scarce occasions when two or three ragged peasants emerged from the\n",
      "crowd to take a hurried peep at Monsieur the Marquis petrified, a\n",
      "skinny finger would not have pointed to it for a minute, before they all\n",
      "started away among the moss and leaves, like the more fortunate hares\n",
      "who could find a living there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chateau and hut, stone face and dangling figure, the red stain on the\n",
      "stone floor, and the pure water in the village well--thousands of acres\n",
      "of land--a whole province of France--all France itself--lay under the\n",
      "night sky, concentrated into a faint hair-breadth line. So does a whole\n",
      "world, with all its greatnesses and littlenesses, lie in a twinkling\n",
      "star. And as mere human knowledge can split a ray of light and analyse\n",
      "the manner of its composition, so, sublimer intelligences may read in\n",
      "the feeble shining of this earth of ours, every thought and act, every\n",
      "vice and virtue, of every responsible creature on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Defarges, husband and wife, came lumbering under the starlight,\n",
      "in their public vehicle, to that gate of Paris whereunto their\n",
      "journey naturally tended. There was the usual stoppage at the barrier\n",
      "guardhouse, and the usual lanterns came glancing forth for the usual\n",
      "examination and inquiry. Monsieur Defarge alighted; knowing one or two\n",
      "of the soldiery there, and one of the police. The latter he was intimate\n",
      "with, and affectionately embraced.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Saint Antoine had again enfolded the Defarges in his dusky wings,\n",
      "and they, having finally alighted near the Saint’s boundaries, were\n",
      "picking their way on foot through the black mud and offal of his\n",
      "streets, Madame Defarge spoke to her husband:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say then, my friend; what did Jacques of the police tell thee?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very little to-night, but all he knows. There is another spy\n",
      "commissioned for our quarter. There may be many more, for all that he\n",
      "can say, but he knows of one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Eh well!” said Madame Defarge, raising her eyebrows with a cool\n",
      "business air. “It is necessary to register him. How do they call that\n",
      "man?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is English.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So much the better. His name?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Barsad,” said Defarge, making it French by pronunciation. But, he had\n",
      "been so careful to get it accurately, that he then spelt it with perfect\n",
      "correctness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Barsad,” repeated madame. “Good. Christian name?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“John.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“John Barsad,” repeated madame, after murmuring it once to herself.\n",
      "“Good. His appearance; is it known?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Age, about forty years; height, about five feet nine; black hair;\n",
      "complexion dark; generally, rather handsome visage; eyes dark, face\n",
      "thin, long, and sallow; nose aquiline, but not straight, having a\n",
      "peculiar inclination towards the left cheek; expression, therefore,\n",
      "sinister.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Eh my faith. It is a portrait!” said madame, laughing. “He shall be\n",
      "registered to-morrow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They turned into the wine-shop, which was closed (for it was midnight),\n",
      "and where Madame Defarge immediately took her post at her desk, counted\n",
      "the small moneys that had been taken during her absence, examined the\n",
      "stock, went through the entries in the book, made other entries of\n",
      "her own, checked the serving man in every possible way, and finally\n",
      "dismissed him to bed. Then she turned out the contents of the bowl\n",
      "of money for the second time, and began knotting them up in her\n",
      "handkerchief, in a chain of separate knots, for safe keeping through the\n",
      "night. All this while, Defarge, with his pipe in his mouth, walked\n",
      "up and down, complacently admiring, but never interfering; in which\n",
      "condition, indeed, as to the business and his domestic affairs, he\n",
      "walked up and down through life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The night was hot, and the shop, close shut and surrounded by so foul a\n",
      "neighbourhood, was ill-smelling. Monsieur Defarge’s olfactory sense was\n",
      "by no means delicate, but the stock of wine smelt much stronger than\n",
      "it ever tasted, and so did the stock of rum and brandy and aniseed. He\n",
      "whiffed the compound of scents away, as he put down his smoked-out pipe.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are fatigued,” said madame, raising her glance as she knotted the\n",
      "money. “There are only the usual odours.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am a little tired,” her husband acknowledged.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are a little depressed, too,” said madame, whose quick eyes had\n",
      "never been so intent on the accounts, but they had had a ray or two for\n",
      "him. “Oh, the men, the men!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But my dear!” began Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But my dear!” repeated madame, nodding firmly; “but my dear! You are\n",
      "faint of heart to-night, my dear!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, then,” said Defarge, as if a thought were wrung out of his\n",
      "breast, “it _is_ a long time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is a long time,” repeated his wife; “and when is it not a long time?\n",
      "Vengeance and retribution require a long time; it is the rule.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It does not take a long time to strike a man with Lightning,” said\n",
      "Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How long,” demanded madame, composedly, “does it take to make and store\n",
      "the lightning? Tell me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Defarge raised his head thoughtfully, as if there were something in that\n",
      "too.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It does not take a long time,” said madame, “for an earthquake to\n",
      "swallow a town. Eh well! Tell me how long it takes to prepare the\n",
      "earthquake?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A long time, I suppose,” said Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But when it is ready, it takes place, and grinds to pieces everything\n",
      "before it. In the meantime, it is always preparing, though it is not\n",
      "seen or heard. That is your consolation. Keep it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She tied a knot with flashing eyes, as if it throttled a foe.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I tell thee,” said madame, extending her right hand, for emphasis,\n",
      "“that although it is a long time on the road, it is on the road and\n",
      "coming. I tell thee it never retreats, and never stops. I tell thee it\n",
      "is always advancing. Look around and consider the lives of all the world\n",
      "that we know, consider the faces of all the world that we know, consider\n",
      "the rage and discontent to which the Jacquerie addresses itself with\n",
      "more and more of certainty every hour. Can such things last? Bah! I mock\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My brave wife,” returned Defarge, standing before her with his head\n",
      "a little bent, and his hands clasped at his back, like a docile and\n",
      "attentive pupil before his catechist, “I do not question all this. But\n",
      "it has lasted a long time, and it is possible--you know well, my wife,\n",
      "it is possible--that it may not come, during our lives.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Eh well! How then?” demanded madame, tying another knot, as if there\n",
      "were another enemy strangled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well!” said Defarge, with a half complaining and half apologetic shrug.\n",
      "“We shall not see the triumph.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We shall have helped it,” returned madame, with her extended hand in\n",
      "strong action. “Nothing that we do, is done in vain. I believe, with all\n",
      "my soul, that we shall see the triumph. But even if not, even if I knew\n",
      "certainly not, show me the neck of an aristocrat and tyrant, and still I\n",
      "would--”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then madame, with her teeth set, tied a very terrible knot indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold!” cried Defarge, reddening a little as if he felt charged with\n",
      "cowardice; “I too, my dear, will stop at nothing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes! But it is your weakness that you sometimes need to see your victim\n",
      "and your opportunity, to sustain you. Sustain yourself without that.\n",
      "When the time comes, let loose a tiger and a devil; but wait for the\n",
      "time with the tiger and the devil chained--not shown--yet always ready.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame enforced the conclusion of this piece of advice by striking her\n",
      "little counter with her chain of money as if she knocked its brains\n",
      "out, and then gathering the heavy handkerchief under her arm in a serene\n",
      "manner, and observing that it was time to go to bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next noontide saw the admirable woman in her usual place in the\n",
      "wine-shop, knitting away assiduously. A rose lay beside her, and if she\n",
      "now and then glanced at the flower, it was with no infraction of her\n",
      "usual preoccupied air. There were a few customers, drinking or not\n",
      "drinking, standing or seated, sprinkled about. The day was very hot,\n",
      "and heaps of flies, who were extending their inquisitive and adventurous\n",
      "perquisitions into all the glutinous little glasses near madame, fell\n",
      "dead at the bottom. Their decease made no impression on the other flies\n",
      "out promenading, who looked at them in the coolest manner (as if they\n",
      "themselves were elephants, or something as far removed), until they met\n",
      "the same fate. Curious to consider how heedless flies are!--perhaps they\n",
      "thought as much at Court that sunny summer day.\n",
      "\n",
      "A figure entering at the door threw a shadow on Madame Defarge which she\n",
      "felt to be a new one. She laid down her knitting, and began to pin her\n",
      "rose in her head-dress, before she looked at the figure.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was curious. The moment Madame Defarge took up the rose, the\n",
      "customers ceased talking, and began gradually to drop out of the\n",
      "wine-shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good day, madame,” said the new-comer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good day, monsieur.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She said it aloud, but added to herself, as she resumed her knitting:\n",
      "“Hah! Good day, age about forty, height about five feet nine, black\n",
      "hair, generally rather handsome visage, complexion dark, eyes dark,\n",
      "thin, long and sallow face, aquiline nose but not straight, having a\n",
      "peculiar inclination towards the left cheek which imparts a sinister\n",
      "expression! Good day, one and all!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac, and a\n",
      "mouthful of cool fresh water, madame.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame complied with a polite air.\n",

      "It was the first time it had ever been so complimented, and Madame\n",
      "Defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better. She said,\n",
      "however, that the cognac was flattered, and took up her knitting. The\n",
      "visitor watched her fingers for a few moments, and took the opportunity\n",
      "of observing the place in general.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You knit with great skill, madame.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“_You_ think so?” said madame, looking at him with a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Decidedly. May one ask what it is for?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pastime,” said madame, still looking at him with a smile while her\n",

      "\n",
      "“Not for use?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That depends. I may find a use for it one day. If I do--Well,” said\n",
      "madame, drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of\n",
      "coquetry, “I’ll use it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was remarkable; but, the taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be\n",
      "decidedly opposed to a rose on the head-dress of Madame Defarge. Two\n",
      "men had entered separately, and had been about to order drink, when,\n",
      "catching sight of that novelty, they faltered, made a pretence of\n",
      "looking about as if for some friend who was not there, and went away.\n",
      "Nor, of those who had been there when this visitor entered, was there\n",
      "one left. They had all dropped off. The spy had kept his eyes open,\n",
      "but had been able to detect no sign. They had lounged away in a\n",
      "poverty-stricken, purposeless, accidental manner, quite natural and\n",
      "unimpeachable.\n",
      "\n",
      "“_John_,” thought madame, checking off her work as her fingers knitted,\n",
      "and her eyes looked at the stranger. “Stay long enough, and I shall knit\n",
      "‘BARSAD’ before you go.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have a husband, madame?”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Business is very bad; the people are so poor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, the unfortunate, miserable people! So oppressed, too--as you say.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“As _you_ say,” madame retorted, correcting him, and deftly knitting an\n",
      "extra something into his name that boded him no good.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pardon me; certainly it was I who said so, but you naturally think so.\n",
      "Of course.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ think?” returned madame, in a high voice. “I and my husband have\n",
      "enough to do to keep this wine-shop open, without thinking. All we\n",
      "think, here, is how to live. That is the subject _we_ think of, and\n",
      "it gives us, from morning to night, enough to think about, without\n",
      "embarrassing our heads concerning others. _I_ think for others? No, no.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The spy, who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make, did\n",
      "not allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinister face; but,\n",
      "stood with an air of gossiping gallantry, leaning his elbow on Madame\n",
      "Defarge’s little counter, and occasionally sipping his cognac.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A bad business this, madame, of Gaspard’s execution. Ah! the poor\n",
      "Gaspard!” With a sigh of great compassion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My faith!” returned madame, coolly and lightly, “if people use knives\n",
      "for such purposes, they have to pay for it. He knew beforehand what the\n",
      "price of his luxury was; he has paid the price.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I believe,” said the spy, dropping his soft voice to a tone\n",
      "that invited confidence, and expressing an injured revolutionary\n",
      "susceptibility in every muscle of his wicked face: “I believe there\n",
      "is much compassion and anger in this neighbourhood, touching the poor\n",
      "fellow? Between ourselves.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is there?” asked madame, vacantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is there not?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“--Here is my husband!” said Madame Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the keeper of the wine-shop entered at the door, the spy saluted\n",
      "him by touching his hat, and saying, with an engaging smile, “Good day,\n",
      "Jacques!” Defarge stopped short, and stared at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good day, Jacques!” the spy repeated; with not quite so much\n",
      "confidence, or quite so easy a smile under the stare.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You deceive yourself, monsieur,” returned the keeper of the wine-shop.\n",
      "“You mistake me for another. That is not my name. I am Ernest Defarge.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is all the same,” said the spy, airily, but discomfited too: “good\n",
      "day!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good day!” answered Defarge, drily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was saying to madame, with whom I had the pleasure of chatting when\n",
      "you entered, that they tell me there is--and no wonder!--much sympathy\n",
      "and anger in Saint Antoine, touching the unhappy fate of poor Gaspard.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No one has told me so,” said Defarge, shaking his head. “I know nothing\n",
      "of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Having said it, he passed behind the little counter, and stood with his\n",
      "hand on the back of his wife’s chair, looking over that barrier at the\n",
      "person to whom they were both opposed, and whom either of them would\n",
      "have shot with the greatest satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "The spy, well used to his business, did not change his unconscious\n",
      "attitude, but drained his little glass of cognac, took a sip of fresh\n",
      "water, and asked for another glass of cognac. Madame Defarge poured it\n",
      "out for him, took to her knitting again, and hummed a little song over\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You seem to know this quarter well; that is to say, better than I do?”\n",
      " observed Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not at all, but I hope to know it better. I am so profoundly interested\n",
      "in its miserable inhabitants.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hah!” muttered Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The pleasure of conversing with you, Monsieur Defarge, recalls to me,”\n",
      " pursued the spy, “that I have the honour of cherishing some interesting\n",
      "associations with your name.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed!” said Defarge, with much indifference.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, indeed. When Doctor Manette was released, you, his old domestic,\n",
      "had the charge of him, I know. He was delivered to you. You see I am\n",
      "informed of the circumstances?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Such is the fact, certainly,” said Defarge. He had had it conveyed\n",
      "to him, in an accidental touch of his wife’s elbow as she knitted and\n",
      "warbled, that he would do best to answer, but always with brevity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was to you,” said the spy, “that his daughter came; and it was\n",
      "from your care that his daughter took him, accompanied by a neat brown\n",
      "monsieur; how is he called?--in a little wig--Lorry--of the bank of\n",
      "Tellson and Company--over to England.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Such is the fact,” repeated Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very interesting remembrances!” said the spy. “I have known Doctor\n",
      "Manette and his daughter, in England.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes?” said Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You don’t hear much about them now?” said the spy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In effect,” madame struck in, looking up from her work and her little\n",
      "song, “we never hear about them. We received the news of their safe\n",
      "arrival, and perhaps another letter, or perhaps two; but, since then,\n",
      "they have gradually taken their road in life--we, ours--and we have held\n",
      "no correspondence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perfectly so, madame,” replied the spy. “She is going to be married.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Going?” echoed madame. “She was pretty enough to have been married long\n",
      "ago. You English are cold, it seems to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! You know I am English.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I perceive your tongue is,” returned madame; “and what the tongue is, I\n",
      "suppose the man is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not take the identification as a compliment; but he made the best\n",
      "of it, and turned it off with a laugh. After sipping his cognac to the\n",
      "end, he added:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Miss Manette is going to be married. But not to an Englishman; to\n",
      "one who, like herself, is French by birth. And speaking of Gaspard (ah,\n",
      "poor Gaspard! It was cruel, cruel!), it is a curious thing that she is\n",
      "going to marry the nephew of Monsieur the Marquis, for whom Gaspard\n",
      "was exalted to that height of so many feet; in other words, the present\n",
      "Marquis. But he lives unknown in England, he is no Marquis there; he is\n",
      "Mr. Charles Darnay. D’Aulnais is the name of his mother’s family.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge knitted steadily, but the intelligence had a palpable\n",
      "effect upon her husband. Do what he would, behind the little counter,\n",
      "as to the striking of a light and the lighting of his pipe, he was\n",
      "troubled, and his hand was not trustworthy. The spy would have been no\n",
      "spy if he had failed to see it, or to record it in his mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having made, at least, this one hit, whatever it might prove to be\n",
      "worth, and no customers coming in to help him to any other, Mr. Barsad\n",
      "paid for what he had drunk, and took his leave: taking occasion to say,\n",
      "in a genteel manner, before he departed, that he looked forward to the\n",
      "pleasure of seeing Monsieur and Madame Defarge again. For some minutes\n",
      "after he had emerged into the outer presence of Saint Antoine, the\n",
      "husband and wife remained exactly as he had left them, lest he should\n",
      "come back.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can it be true,” said Defarge, in a low voice, looking down at his wife\n",
      "as he stood smoking with his hand on the back of her chair: “what he has\n",
      "said of Ma’amselle Manette?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“As he has said it,” returned madame, lifting her eyebrows a little, “it\n",
      "is probably false. But it may be true.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If it is--” Defarge began, and stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If it is?” repeated his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "“--And if it does come, while we live to see it triumph--I hope, for her\n",
      "sake, Destiny will keep her husband out of France.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Her husband’s destiny,” said Madame Defarge, with her usual composure,\n",
      "“will take him where he is to go, and will lead him to the end that is\n",
      "to end him. That is all I know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But it is very strange--now, at least, is it not very strange”--said\n",
      "Defarge, rather pleading with his wife to induce her to admit it,\n",
      "“that, after all our sympathy for Monsieur her father, and herself, her\n",
      "husband’s name should be proscribed under your hand at this moment, by\n",
      "the side of that infernal dog’s who has just left us?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stranger things than that will happen when it does come,” answered\n",
      "madame. “I have them both here, of a certainty; and they are both here\n",
      "for their merits; that is enough.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She rolled up her knitting when she had said those words, and presently\n",
      "took the rose out of the handkerchief that was wound about her head.\n",
      "Either Saint Antoine had an instinctive sense that the objectionable\n",
      "decoration was gone, or Saint Antoine was on the watch for its\n",
      "disappearance; howbeit, the Saint took courage to lounge in, very\n",
      "shortly afterwards, and the wine-shop recovered its habitual aspect.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the evening, at which season of all others Saint Antoine turned\n",
      "himself inside out, and sat on door-steps and window-ledges, and came\n",
      "to the corners of vile streets and courts, for a breath of air, Madame\n",
      "Defarge with her work in her hand was accustomed to pass from place\n",
      "to place and from group to group: a Missionary--there were many like\n",
      "her--such as the world will do well never to breed again. All the women\n",
      "knitted. They knitted worthless things; but, the mechanical work was a\n",
      "mechanical substitute for eating and drinking; the hands moved for the\n",
      "jaws and the digestive apparatus: if the bony fingers had been still,\n",
      "the stomachs would have been more famine-pinched.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, as the fingers went, the eyes went, and the thoughts. And as Madame\n",
      "Defarge moved on from group to group, all three went quicker and fiercer\n",
      "among every little knot of women that she had spoken with, and left\n",
      "behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her husband smoked at his door, looking after her with admiration. “A\n",

      "leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress. I have seen her\n",
      "image in the moonlight often, as I now see you; except that I never held\n",

      "and more real child. Of her outward appearance I know no more than\n",
      "that she was like her mother. The other had that likeness too--as you\n",
      "have--but was not the same. Can you follow me, Lucie? Hardly, I think?\n",

      "life was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father. My picture\n",

      "up at its bars, and spoke in whispers. She could never deliver me; I\n",

      "shadow at a distance, crept up to his bed, and put her lips to his;\n",
      "then, leaned over him, and looked at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Into his handsome face, the bitter waters of captivity had worn; but, he\n",

      "sorrows deserved. Then, she withdrew her hand, and kissed his lips once\n",
      "more, and went away. So, the sunrise came, and the shadows of the leaves\n",

      "but for the yet lingering consideration that her brother Solomon should\n",
      "have been the bridegroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And so,” said Mr. Lorry, who could not sufficiently admire the bride,\n",
      "and who had been moving round her to take in every point of her quiet,\n",
      "pretty dress; “and so it was for this, my sweet Lucie, that I brought\n",
      "you across the Channel, such a baby! Lord bless me! How little I thought\n",

      "\n",
      "“You were, just now; I saw you do it, and I don’t wonder at it. Such\n",

      "“I am highly gratified,” said Mr. Lorry, “though, upon my honour, I\n",
      "had no intention of rendering those trifling articles of remembrance\n",
      "invisible to any one. Dear me! This is an occasion that makes a man\n",
      "speculate on all he has lost. Dear, dear, dear! To think that there\n",
      "might have been a Mrs. Lorry, any time these fifty years almost!”\n",

      "“Well!” observed Mr. Lorry, beamingly adjusting his little wig, “that\n",
      "seems probable, too.”\n",

      "“And you were cut out for a bachelor,” pursued Miss Pross, “before you\n",
      "were put in your cradle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then, I think,” said Mr. Lorry, “that I was very unhandsomely dealt\n",
      "with, and that I ought to have had a voice in the selection of my\n",
      "pattern. Enough! Now, my dear Lucie,” drawing his arm soothingly round\n",
      "her waist, “I hear them moving in the next room, and Miss Pross and\n",
      "I, as two formal folks of business, are anxious not to lose the final\n",
      "opportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear. You leave\n",
      "your good father, my dear, in hands as earnest and as loving as your\n",
      "own; he shall be taken every conceivable care of; during the next\n",
      "fortnight, while you are in Warwickshire and thereabouts, even Tellson’s\n",
      "shall go to the wall (comparatively speaking) before him. And when, at\n",
      "the fortnight’s end, he comes to join you and your beloved husband, on\n",
      "your other fortnight’s trip in Wales, you shall say that we have sent\n",
      "him to you in the best health and in the happiest frame. Now, I hear\n",
      "Somebody’s step coming to the door. Let me kiss my dear girl with an\n",
      "old-fashioned bachelor blessing, before Somebody comes to claim his\n",
      "own.”\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment, he held the fair face from him to look at the\n",
      "well-remembered expression on the forehead, and then laid the bright\n",
      "golden hair against his little brown wig, with a genuine tenderness and\n",
      "delicacy which, if such things be old-fashioned, were as old as Adam.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door of the Doctor’s room opened, and he came out with Charles\n",
      "Darnay. He was so deadly pale--which had not been the case when they\n",
      "went in together--that no vestige of colour was to be seen in his face.\n",
      "But, in the composure of his manner he was unaltered, except that to the\n",
      "shrewd glance of Mr. Lorry it disclosed some shadowy indication that the\n",
      "old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over him, like a cold\n",
      "wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "He gave his arm to his daughter, and took her down-stairs to the chariot\n",
      "which Mr. Lorry had hired in honour of the day. The rest followed in\n",
      "another carriage, and soon, in a neighbouring church, where no strange\n",
      "eyes looked on, Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette were happily married.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little\n",
      "group when it was done, some diamonds, very bright and sparkling,\n",
      "glanced on the bride’s hand, which were newly released from the\n",
      "dark obscurity of one of Mr. Lorry’s pockets. They returned home to\n",
      "breakfast, and all went well, and in due course the golden hair that had\n",
      "mingled with the poor shoemaker’s white locks in the Paris garret, were\n",
      "mingled with them again in the morning sunlight, on the threshold of the\n",
      "door at parting.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a hard parting, though it was not for long. But her father\n",
      "cheered her, and said at last, gently disengaging himself from her\n",
      "enfolding arms, “Take her, Charles! She is yours!”\n",
      "\n",
      "And her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window, and she was\n",
      "gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The corner being out of the way of the idle and curious, and the\n",
      "preparations having been very simple and few, the Doctor, Mr. Lorry,\n",
      "and Miss Pross, were left quite alone. It was when they turned into\n",
      "the welcome shade of the cool old hall, that Mr. Lorry observed a great\n",
      "change to have come over the Doctor; as if the golden arm uplifted\n",
      "there, had struck him a poisoned blow.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had naturally repressed much, and some revulsion might have been\n",
      "expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone. But, it was\n",
      "the old scared lost look that troubled Mr. Lorry; and through his absent\n",
      "manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own\n",
      "room when they got up-stairs, Mr. Lorry was reminded of Defarge the\n",
      "wine-shop keeper, and the starlight ride.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think,” he whispered to Miss Pross, after anxious consideration, “I\n",
      "think we had best not speak to him just now, or at all disturb him.\n",
      "I must look in at Tellson’s; so I will go there at once and come back\n",
      "presently. Then, we will take him a ride into the country, and dine\n",
      "there, and all will be well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was easier for Mr. Lorry to look in at Tellson’s, than to look out of\n",
      "Tellson’s. He was detained two hours. When he came back, he ascended the\n",
      "old staircase alone, having asked no question of the servant; going thus\n",
      "into the Doctor’s rooms, he was stopped by a low sound of knocking.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good God!” he said, with a start. “What’s that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Pross, with a terrified face, was at his ear. “O me, O me! All is\n",
      "lost!” cried she, wringing her hands. “What is to be told to Ladybird?\n",
      "He doesn’t know me, and is making shoes!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry said what he could to calm her, and went himself into the\n",
      "Doctor’s room. The bench was turned towards the light, as it had been\n",
      "when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before, and his head was bent\n",
      "down, and he was very busy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Doctor Manette. My dear friend, Doctor Manette!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Doctor looked at him for a moment--half inquiringly, half as if he\n",
      "were angry at being spoken to--and bent over his work again.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had laid aside his coat and waistcoat; his shirt was open at the\n",
      "throat, as it used to be when he did that work; and even the old\n",
      "haggard, faded surface of face had come back to him. He worked\n",
      "hard--impatiently--as if in some sense of having been interrupted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry glanced at the work in his hand, and observed that it was a\n",
      "shoe of the old size and shape. He took up another that was lying by\n",
      "him, and asked what it was.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A young lady’s walking shoe,” he muttered, without looking up. “It\n",
      "ought to have been finished long ago. Let it be.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, Doctor Manette. Look at me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He obeyed, in the old mechanically submissive manner, without pausing in\n",
      "his work.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You know me, my dear friend? Think again. This is not your proper\n",
      "occupation. Think, dear friend!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing would induce him to speak more. He looked up, for an instant at\n",
      "a time, when he was requested to do so; but, no persuasion would extract\n",
      "a word from him. He worked, and worked, and worked, in silence, and\n",
      "words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall, or on\n",
      "the air. The only ray of hope that Mr. Lorry could discover, was, that\n",
      "he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked. In that, there\n",
      "seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexity--as though he were\n",
      "trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two things at once impressed themselves on Mr. Lorry, as important above\n",
      "all others; the first, that this must be kept secret from Lucie;\n",
      "the second, that it must be kept secret from all who knew him. In\n",
      "conjunction with Miss Pross, he took immediate steps towards the latter\n",
      "precaution, by giving out that the Doctor was not well, and required a\n",
      "few days of complete rest. In aid of the kind deception to be practised\n",
      "on his daughter, Miss Pross was to write, describing his having been\n",
      "called away professionally, and referring to an imaginary letter of\n",
      "two or three hurried lines in his own hand, represented to have been\n",
      "addressed to her by the same post.\n",
      "\n",
      "These measures, advisable to be taken in any case, Mr. Lorry took in\n",
      "the hope of his coming to himself. If that should happen soon, he kept\n",
      "another course in reserve; which was, to have a certain opinion that he\n",
      "thought the best, on the Doctor’s case.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the hope of his recovery, and of resort to this third course\n",
      "being thereby rendered practicable, Mr. Lorry resolved to watch him\n",
      "attentively, with as little appearance as possible of doing so. He\n",
      "therefore made arrangements to absent himself from Tellson’s for the\n",
      "first time in his life, and took his post by the window in the same\n",
      "room.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak\n",
      "to him, since, on being pressed, he became worried. He abandoned that\n",
      "attempt on the first day, and resolved merely to keep himself always\n",
      "before him, as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had\n",
      "fallen, or was falling. He remained, therefore, in his seat near the\n",
      "window, reading and writing, and expressing in as many pleasant and\n",
      "natural ways as he could think of, that it was a free place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctor Manette took what was given him to eat and drink, and worked on,\n",
      "that first day, until it was too dark to see--worked on, half an hour\n",
      "after Mr. Lorry could not have seen, for his life, to read or write.\n",
      "When he put his tools aside as useless, until morning, Mr. Lorry rose\n",
      "and said to him:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Will you go out?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner,\n",
      "looked up in the old manner, and repeated in the old low voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Out?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; for a walk with me. Why not?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He made no effort to say why not, and said not a word more. But, Mr.\n",
      "Lorry thought he saw, as he leaned forward on his bench in the dusk,\n",
      "with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands, that he was in\n",
      "some misty way asking himself, “Why not?” The sagacity of the man of\n",
      "business perceived an advantage here, and determined to hold it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Pross and he divided the night into two watches, and observed him\n",
      "at intervals from the adjoining room. He paced up and down for a long\n",
      "time before he lay down; but, when he did finally lay himself down, he\n",
      "fell asleep. In the morning, he was up betimes, and went straight to his\n",
      "bench and to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "On this second day, Mr. Lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name,\n",
      "and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them. He\n",
      "returned no reply, but it was evident that he heard what was said, and\n",
      "that he thought about it, however confusedly. This encouraged Mr. Lorry\n",
      "to have Miss Pross in with her work, several times during the day;\n",
      "at those times, they quietly spoke of Lucie, and of her father then\n",
      "present, precisely in the usual manner, and as if there were nothing\n",
      "amiss. This was done without any demonstrative accompaniment, not long\n",
      "enough, or often enough to harass him; and it lightened Mr. Lorry’s\n",
      "friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener, and that he\n",
      "appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it fell dark again, Mr. Lorry asked him as before:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear Doctor, will you go out?”\n",
      "\n",
      "As before, he repeated, “Out?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; for a walk with me. Why not?”\n",
      "\n",
      "This time, Mr. Lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no answer\n",
      "from him, and, after remaining absent for an hour, returned. In the\n",
      "meanwhile, the Doctor had removed to the seat in the window, and had\n",
      "sat there looking down at the plane-tree; but, on Mr. Lorry’s return, he\n",
      "slipped away to his bench.\n",
      "\n",
      "The time went very slowly on, and Mr. Lorry’s hope darkened, and his\n",
      "heart grew heavier again, and grew yet heavier and heavier every day.\n",
      "The third day came and went, the fourth, the fifth. Five days, six days,\n",
      "seven days, eight days, nine days.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a hope ever darkening, and with a heart always growing heavier and\n",
      "heavier, Mr. Lorry passed through this anxious time. The secret was\n",
      "well kept, and Lucie was unconscious and happy; but he could not fail to\n",
      "observe that the shoemaker, whose hand had been a little out at first,\n",
      "was growing dreadfully skilful, and that he had never been so intent on\n",

      "night.\n",
      "\n",
      "He rubbed his eyes and roused himself; but he doubted, when he had\n",
      "done so, whether he was not still asleep. For, going to the door of the\n",
      "Doctor’s room and looking in, he perceived that the shoemaker’s bench\n",
      "and tools were put aside again, and that the Doctor himself sat reading\n",
      "at the window. He was in his usual morning dress, and his face (which\n",
      "Mr. Lorry could distinctly see), though still very pale, was calmly\n",
      "studious and attentive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake, Mr. Lorry felt\n",
      "giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might\n",
      "not be a disturbed dream of his own; for, did not his eyes show him his\n",
      "friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect, and employed\n",
      "as usual; and was there any sign within their range, that the change of\n",
      "which he had so strong an impression had actually happened?\n",
      "\n",
      "It was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment, the\n",
      "answer being obvious. If the impression were not produced by a real\n",
      "corresponding and sufficient cause, how came he, Jarvis Lorry, there?\n",
      "How came he to have fallen asleep, in his clothes, on the sofa in Doctor\n",
      "Manette’s consulting-room, and to be debating these points outside the\n",
      "Doctor’s bedroom door in the early morning?\n",
      "\n",
      "Within a few minutes, Miss Pross stood whispering at his side. If he\n",
      "had had any particle of doubt left, her talk would of necessity have\n",
      "resolved it; but he was by that time clear-headed, and had none.\n",
      "He advised that they should let the time go by until the regular\n",
      "breakfast-hour, and should then meet the Doctor as if nothing unusual\n",
      "had occurred. If he appeared to be in his customary state of mind, Mr.\n",
      "Lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from\n",
      "the opinion he had been, in his anxiety, so anxious to obtain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Pross, submitting herself to his judgment, the scheme was worked\n",
      "out with care. Having abundance of time for his usual methodical\n",
      "toilette, Mr. Lorry presented himself at the breakfast-hour in his usual\n",
      "white linen, and with his usual neat leg. The Doctor was summoned in the\n",
      "usual way, and came to breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "So far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those\n",
      "delicate and gradual approaches which Mr. Lorry felt to be the only safe\n",
      "advance, he at first supposed that his daughter’s marriage had taken\n",
      "place yesterday. An incidental allusion, purposely thrown out, to\n",
      "the day of the week, and the day of the month, set him thinking and\n",
      "counting, and evidently made him uneasy. In all other respects, however,\n",
      "he was so composedly himself, that Mr. Lorry determined to have the aid\n",
      "he sought. And that aid was his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, when the breakfast was done and cleared away, and he and the\n",
      "Doctor were left together, Mr. Lorry said, feelingly:\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear Manette, I am anxious to have your opinion, in confidence, on a\n",
      "very curious case in which I am deeply interested; that is to say, it is\n",
      "very curious to me; perhaps, to your better information it may be less\n",
      "so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Glancing at his hands, which were discoloured by his late work, the\n",
      "Doctor looked troubled, and listened attentively. He had already glanced\n",
      "at his hands more than once.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Doctor Manette,” said Mr. Lorry, touching him affectionately on the\n",
      "arm, “the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine. Pray\n",
      "give your mind to it, and advise me well for his sake--and above all,\n",
      "for his daughter’s--his daughter’s, my dear Manette.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I understand,” said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, “some mental\n",
      "shock--?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Be explicit,” said the Doctor. “Spare no detail.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry saw that they understood one another, and proceeded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear Manette, it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock,\n",
      "of great acuteness and severity to the affections, the feelings,\n",
      "the--the--as you express it--the mind. The mind. It is the case of a\n",
      "shock under which the sufferer was borne down, one cannot say for how\n",
      "long, because I believe he cannot calculate the time himself, and there\n",
      "are no other means of getting at it. It is the case of a shock from\n",
      "which the sufferer recovered, by a process that he cannot trace\n",
      "himself--as I once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner. It is\n",
      "the case of a shock from which he has recovered, so completely, as to\n",
      "be a highly intelligent man, capable of close application of mind, and\n",
      "great exertion of body, and of constantly making fresh additions to his\n",
      "stock of knowledge, which was already very large. But, unfortunately,\n",
      "there has been,” he paused and took a deep breath--“a slight relapse.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Doctor, in a low voice, asked, “Of how long duration?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nine days and nights.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How did it show itself? I infer,” glancing at his hands again, “in the\n",
      "resumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is the fact.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, did you ever see him,” asked the Doctor, distinctly and\n",
      "collectedly, though in the same low voice, “engaged in that pursuit\n",
      "originally?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Once.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And when the relapse fell on him, was he in most respects--or in all\n",
      "respects--as he was then?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think in all respects.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You spoke of his daughter. Does his daughter know of the relapse?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. It has been kept from her, and I hope will always be kept from her.\n",
      "It is known only to myself, and to one other who may be trusted.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Doctor grasped his hand, and murmured, “That was very kind. That was\n",
      "very thoughtful!” Mr. Lorry grasped his hand in return, and neither of\n",
      "the two spoke for a little while.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, my dear Manette,” said Mr. Lorry, at length, in his most\n",
      "considerate and most affectionate way, “I am a mere man of business,\n",
      "and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters. I do not\n",
      "possess the kind of information necessary; I do not possess the kind of\n",
      "intelligence; I want guiding. There is no man in this world on whom\n",
      "I could so rely for right guidance, as on you. Tell me, how does this\n",
      "relapse come about? Is there danger of another? Could a repetition of it\n",
      "be prevented? How should a repetition of it be treated? How does it come\n",
      "about at all? What can I do for my friend? No man ever can have been\n",
      "more desirous in his heart to serve a friend, than I am to serve mine,\n",
      "if I knew how.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I don’t know how to originate, in such a case. If your sagacity,\n",
      "knowledge, and experience, could put me on the right track, I might be\n",
      "able to do so much; unenlightened and undirected, I can do so little.\n",
      "Pray discuss it with me; pray enable me to see it a little more clearly,\n",
      "and teach me how to be a little more useful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctor Manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken, and\n",
      "Mr. Lorry did not press him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think it probable,” said the Doctor, breaking silence with an effort,\n",
      "“that the relapse you have described, my dear friend, was not quite\n",
      "unforeseen by its subject.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Was it dreaded by him?” Mr. Lorry ventured to ask.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very much.” He said it with an involuntary shudder.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferer’s\n",
      "mind, and how difficult--how almost impossible--it is, for him to force\n",
      "himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Would he,” asked Mr. Lorry, “be sensibly relieved if he could prevail\n",
      "upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one, when it is on\n",
      "him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think so. But it is, as I have told you, next to impossible. I even\n",
      "believe it--in some cases--to be quite impossible.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now,” said Mr. Lorry, gently laying his hand on the Doctor’s arm again,\n",
      "after a short silence on both sides, “to what would you refer this\n",
      "attack?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I believe,” returned Doctor Manette, “that there had been a strong and\n",
      "extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that\n",
      "was the first cause of the malady. Some intense associations of a most\n",
      "distressing nature were vividly recalled, I think. It is probable that\n",
      "there had long been a dread lurking in his mind, that those associations\n",
      "would be recalled--say, under certain circumstances--say, on a\n",
      "particular occasion. He tried to prepare himself in vain; perhaps the\n",
      "effort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Would he remember what took place in the relapse?” asked Mr. Lorry,\n",
      "with natural hesitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Doctor looked desolately round the room, shook his head, and\n",
      "answered, in a low voice, “Not at all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, as to the future,” hinted Mr. Lorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As to the future,” said the Doctor, recovering firmness, “I should have\n",
      "great hope. As it pleased Heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon, I\n",
      "should have great hope. He, yielding under the pressure of a complicated\n",
      "something, long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against,\n",
      "and recovering after the cloud had burst and passed, I should hope that\n",
      "the worst was over.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, well! That’s good comfort. I am thankful!” said Mr. Lorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am thankful!” repeated the Doctor, bending his head with reverence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are two other points,” said Mr. Lorry, “on which I am anxious to\n",
      "be instructed. I may go on?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You cannot do your friend a better service.” The Doctor gave him his\n",
      "hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To the first, then. He is of a studious habit, and unusually energetic;\n",
      "he applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional\n",
      "knowledge, to the conducting of experiments, to many things. Now, does\n",
      "he do too much?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think not. It may be the character of his mind, to be always in\n",
      "singular need of occupation. That may be, in part, natural to it; in\n",
      "part, the result of affliction. The less it was occupied with healthy\n",
      "things, the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy\n",
      "direction. He may have observed himself, and made the discovery.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are sure that he is not under too great a strain?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think I am quite sure of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear Manette, if he were overworked now--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear Lorry, I doubt if that could easily be. There has been a\n",
      "violent stress in one direction, and it needs a counterweight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Excuse me, as a persistent man of business. Assuming for a moment,\n",
      "that he _was_ overworked; it would show itself in some renewal of this\n",
      "disorder?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not think so. I do not think,” said Doctor Manette with the\n",
      "firmness of self-conviction, “that anything but the one train of\n",
      "association would renew it. I think that, henceforth, nothing but some\n",
      "extraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it. After what has\n",
      "happened, and after his recovery, I find it difficult to imagine any\n",
      "such violent sounding of that string again. I trust, and I almost\n",
      "believe, that the circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He spoke with the diffidence of a man who knew how slight a thing\n",
      "would overset the delicate organisation of the mind, and yet with the\n",
      "confidence of a man who had slowly won his assurance out of personal\n",
      "endurance and distress. It was not for his friend to abate that\n",
      "confidence. He professed himself more relieved and encouraged than he\n",
      "really was, and approached his second and last point. He felt it to\n",
      "be the most difficult of all; but, remembering his old Sunday morning\n",
      "conversation with Miss Pross, and remembering what he had seen in the\n",
      "last nine days, he knew that he must face it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction\n",
      "so happily recovered from,” said Mr. Lorry, clearing his throat, “we\n",
      "will call--Blacksmith’s work, Blacksmith’s work. We will say, to put a\n",
      "case and for the sake of illustration, that he had been used, in his bad\n",
      "time, to work at a little forge. We will say that he was unexpectedly\n",
      "found at his forge again. Is it not a pity that he should keep it by\n",
      "him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Doctor shaded his forehead with his hand, and beat his foot\n",
      "nervously on the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He has always kept it by him,” said Mr. Lorry, with an anxious look at\n",
      "his friend. “Now, would it not be better that he should let it go?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, the Doctor, with shaded forehead, beat his foot nervously on the\n",
      "ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You do not find it easy to advise me?” said Mr. Lorry. “I quite\n",
      "understand it to be a nice question. And yet I think--” And there he\n",
      "shook his head, and stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You see,” said Doctor Manette, turning to him after an uneasy pause,\n",
      "“it is very hard to explain, consistently, the innermost workings\n",
      "of this poor man’s mind. He once yearned so frightfully for that\n",
      "occupation, and it was so welcome when it came; no doubt it relieved\n",
      "his pain so much, by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for\n",
      "the perplexity of the brain, and by substituting, as he became more\n",
      "practised, the ingenuity of the hands, for the ingenuity of the mental\n",
      "torture; that he has never been able to bear the thought of putting it\n",
      "quite out of his reach. Even now, when I believe he is more hopeful of\n",
      "himself than he has ever been, and even speaks of himself with a kind\n",
      "of confidence, the idea that he might need that old employment, and not\n",
      "find it, gives him a sudden sense of terror, like that which one may\n",
      "fancy strikes to the heart of a lost child.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked like his illustration, as he raised his eyes to Mr. Lorry’s\n",
      "face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But may not--mind! I ask for information, as a plodding man of business\n",
      "who only deals with such material objects as guineas, shillings, and\n",
      "bank-notes--may not the retention of the thing involve the retention of\n",
      "the idea? If the thing were gone, my dear Manette, might not the fear go\n",
      "with it? In short, is it not a concession to the misgiving, to keep the\n",
      "forge?”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was another silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You see, too,” said the Doctor, tremulously, “it is such an old\n",
      "companion.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I would not keep it,” said Mr. Lorry, shaking his head; for he gained\n",
      "in firmness as he saw the Doctor disquieted. “I would recommend him to\n",
      "sacrifice it. I only want your authority. I am sure it does no good.\n",
      "Come! Give me your authority, like a dear good man. For his daughter’s\n",
      "sake, my dear Manette!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Very strange to see what a struggle there was within him!\n",
      "\n",
      "“In her name, then, let it be done; I sanction it. But, I would not take\n",
      "it away while he was present. Let it be removed when he is not there;\n",
      "let him miss his old companion after an absence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry readily engaged for that, and the conference was ended. They\n",
      "passed the day in the country, and the Doctor was quite restored. On the\n",
      "three following days he remained perfectly well, and on the fourteenth\n",
      "day he went away to join Lucie and her husband. The precaution that\n",
      "had been taken to account for his silence, Mr. Lorry had previously\n",
      "explained to him, and he had written to Lucie in accordance with it, and\n",
      "she had no suspicions.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the night of the day on which he left the house, Mr. Lorry went into\n",
      "his room with a chopper, saw, chisel, and hammer, attended by Miss Pross\n",
      "carrying a light. There, with closed doors, and in a mysterious and\n",
      "guilty manner, Mr. Lorry hacked the shoemaker’s bench to pieces, while\n",
      "Miss Pross held the candle as if she were assisting at a murder--for\n",
      "which, indeed, in her grimness, she was no unsuitable figure. The\n",
      "burning of the body (previously reduced to pieces convenient for the\n",
      "purpose) was commenced without delay in the kitchen fire; and the tools,\n",
      "shoes, and leather, were buried in the garden. So wicked do destruction\n",
      "and secrecy appear to honest minds, that Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross,\n",
      "while engaged in the commission of their deed and in the removal of its\n",

      "When the newly-married pair came home, the first person who appeared, to\n",

      "many hours, when he presented himself. He was not improved in habits, or\n",
      "in looks, or in manner; but there was a certain rugged air of fidelity\n",
      "about him, which was new to the observation of Charles Darnay.\n",
      "\n",
      "He watched his opportunity of taking Darnay aside into a window, and of\n",

      "“Upon my life,” said Carton, smiling, “I find that easier to comprehend\n",
      "in my own mind, than to convey to yours. However, let me try. You\n",

      "away. “On the drunken occasion in question (one of a large number, as\n",
      "you know), I was insufferable about liking you, and not liking you. I\n",

      "Echoing Footsteps\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A wonderful corner for echoes, it has been remarked, that corner where\n",
      "the Doctor lived. Ever busily winding the golden thread which bound\n",
      "her husband, and her father, and herself, and her old directress and\n",
      "companion, in a life of quiet bliss, Lucie sat in the still house in\n",
      "the tranquilly resounding corner, listening to the echoing footsteps of\n",
      "years.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first, there were times, though she was a perfectly happy young wife,\n",
      "when her work would slowly fall from her hands, and her eyes would be\n",
      "dimmed. For, there was something coming in the echoes, something light,\n",
      "afar off, and scarcely audible yet, that stirred her heart too much.\n",
      "Fluttering hopes and doubts--hopes, of a love as yet unknown to her:\n",
      "doubts, of her remaining upon earth, to enjoy that new delight--divided\n",
      "her breast. Among the echoes then, there would arise the sound of\n",
      "footsteps at her own early grave; and thoughts of the husband who would\n",
      "be left so desolate, and who would mourn for her so much, swelled to her\n",
      "eyes, and broke like waves.\n",
      "\n",
      "That time passed, and her little Lucie lay on her bosom. Then, among the\n",
      "advancing echoes, there was the tread of her tiny feet and the sound of\n",
      "her prattling words. Let greater echoes resound as they would, the young\n",
      "mother at the cradle side could always hear those coming. They came, and\n",
      "the shady house was sunny with a child’s laugh, and the Divine friend of\n",
      "children, to whom in her trouble she had confided hers, seemed to take\n",
      "her child in his arms, as He took the child of old, and made it a sacred\n",
      "joy to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ever busily winding the golden thread that bound them all together,\n",
      "weaving the service of her happy influence through the tissue of all\n",
      "their lives, and making it predominate nowhere, Lucie heard in the\n",
      "echoes of years none but friendly and soothing sounds. Her husband’s\n",
      "step was strong and prosperous among them; her father’s firm and equal.\n",
      "Lo, Miss Pross, in harness of string, awakening the echoes, as an\n",
      "unruly charger, whip-corrected, snorting and pawing the earth under the\n",
      "plane-tree in the garden!\n",
      "\n",
      "Even when there were sounds of sorrow among the rest, they were not\n",
      "harsh nor cruel. Even when golden hair, like her own, lay in a halo on a\n",
      "pillow round the worn face of a little boy, and he said, with a radiant\n",
      "smile, “Dear papa and mamma, I am very sorry to leave you both, and to\n",
      "leave my pretty sister; but I am called, and I must go!” those were not\n",
      "tears all of agony that wetted his young mother’s cheek, as the spirit\n",
      "departed from her embrace that had been entrusted to it. Suffer them and\n",
      "forbid them not. They see my Father’s face. O Father, blessed words!\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the rustling of an Angel’s wings got blended with the other\n",
      "echoes, and they were not wholly of earth, but had in them that breath\n",
      "of Heaven. Sighs of the winds that blew over a little garden-tomb were\n",
      "mingled with them also, and both were audible to Lucie, in a hushed\n",
      "murmur--like the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a sandy shore--as\n",
      "the little Lucie, comically studious at the task of the morning, or\n",
      "dressing a doll at her mother’s footstool, chattered in the tongues of\n",
      "the Two Cities that were blended in her life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Echoes rarely answered to the actual tread of Sydney Carton. Some\n",
      "half-dozen times a year, at most, he claimed his privilege of coming in\n",
      "uninvited, and would sit among them through the evening, as he had once\n",
      "done often. He never came there heated with wine. And one other thing\n",
      "regarding him was whispered in the echoes, which has been whispered by\n",
      "all true echoes for ages and ages.\n",
      "\n",
      "No man ever really loved a woman, lost her, and knew her with a\n",
      "blameless though an unchanged mind, when she was a wife and a mother,\n",
      "but her children had a strange sympathy with him--an instinctive\n",
      "delicacy of pity for him. What fine hidden sensibilities are touched in\n",
      "such a case, no echoes tell; but it is so, and it was so here. Carton\n",
      "was the first stranger to whom little Lucie held out her chubby arms,\n",
      "and he kept his place with her as she grew. The little boy had spoken of\n",
      "him, almost at the last. “Poor Carton! Kiss him for me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Stryver shouldered his way through the law, like some great engine\n",
      "forcing itself through turbid water, and dragged his useful friend in\n",
      "his wake, like a boat towed astern. As the boat so favoured is usually\n",
      "in a rough plight, and mostly under water, so, Sydney had a swamped\n",
      "life of it. But, easy and strong custom, unhappily so much easier and\n",
      "stronger in him than any stimulating sense of desert or disgrace, made\n",
      "it the life he was to lead; and he no more thought of emerging from his\n",
      "state of lion’s jackal, than any real jackal may be supposed to think of\n",
      "rising to be a lion. Stryver was rich; had married a florid widow with\n",
      "property and three boys, who had nothing particularly shining about them\n",
      "but the straight hair of their dumpling heads.\n",
      "\n",
      "These three young gentlemen, Mr. Stryver, exuding patronage of the most\n",
      "offensive quality from every pore, had walked before him like three\n",
      "sheep to the quiet corner in Soho, and had offered as pupils to\n",
      "Lucie’s husband: delicately saying “Halloa! here are three lumps of\n",
      "bread-and-cheese towards your matrimonial picnic, Darnay!” The polite\n",
      "rejection of the three lumps of bread-and-cheese had quite bloated Mr.\n",
      "Stryver with indignation, which he afterwards turned to account in the\n",
      "training of the young gentlemen, by directing them to beware of the\n",
      "pride of Beggars, like that tutor-fellow. He was also in the habit of\n",
      "declaiming to Mrs. Stryver, over his full-bodied wine, on the arts\n",
      "Mrs. Darnay had once put in practice to “catch” him, and on the\n",
      "diamond-cut-diamond arts in himself, madam, which had rendered him “not\n",
      "to be caught.” Some of his King’s Bench familiars, who were occasionally\n",
      "parties to the full-bodied wine and the lie, excused him for the\n",
      "latter by saying that he had told it so often, that he believed\n",
      "it himself--which is surely such an incorrigible aggravation of an\n",
      "originally bad offence, as to justify any such offender’s being carried\n",
      "off to some suitably retired spot, and there hanged out of the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "These were among the echoes to which Lucie, sometimes pensive, sometimes\n",
      "amused and laughing, listened in the echoing corner, until her little\n",
      "daughter was six years old. How near to her heart the echoes of her\n",
      "child’s tread came, and those of her own dear father’s, always active\n",
      "and self-possessed, and those of her dear husband’s, need not be told.\n",
      "Nor, how the lightest echo of their united home, directed by herself\n",
      "with such a wise and elegant thrift that it was more abundant than any\n",
      "waste, was music to her. Nor, how there were echoes all about her, sweet\n",
      "in her ears, of the many times her father had told her that he found her\n",
      "more devoted to him married (if that could be) than single, and of the\n",
      "many times her husband had said to her that no cares and duties seemed\n",
      "to divide her love for him or her help to him, and asked her “What is\n",
      "the magic secret, my darling, of your being everything to all of us,\n",
      "as if there were only one of us, yet never seeming to be hurried, or to\n",
      "have too much to do?”\n",
      "\n",
      "But, there were other echoes, from a distance, that rumbled menacingly\n",
      "in the corner all through this space of time. And it was now, about\n",
      "little Lucie’s sixth birthday, that they began to have an awful sound,\n",
      "as of a great storm in France with a dreadful sea rising.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a night in mid-July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine, Mr.\n",
      "Lorry came in late, from Tellson’s, and sat himself down by Lucie and\n",
      "her husband in the dark window. It was a hot, wild night, and they were\n",
      "all three reminded of the old Sunday night when they had looked at the\n",
      "lightning from the same place.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I began to think,” said Mr. Lorry, pushing his brown wig back, “that\n",
      "I should have to pass the night at Tellson’s. We have been so full of\n",
      "business all day, that we have not known what to do first, or which way\n",
      "to turn. There is such an uneasiness in Paris, that we have actually a\n",
      "run of confidence upon us! Our customers over there, seem not to be able\n",
      "to confide their property to us fast enough. There is positively a mania\n",
      "among some of them for sending it to England.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That has a bad look,” said Darnay--\n",
      "\n",
      "“A bad look, you say, my dear Darnay? Yes, but we don’t know what reason\n",
      "there is in it. People are so unreasonable! Some of us at Tellson’s are\n",
      "getting old, and we really can’t be troubled out of the ordinary course\n",
      "without due occasion.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Still,” said Darnay, “you know how gloomy and threatening the sky is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know that, to be sure,” assented Mr. Lorry, trying to persuade\n",
      "himself that his sweet temper was soured, and that he grumbled, “but I\n",
      "am determined to be peevish after my long day’s botheration. Where is\n",
      "Manette?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here he is,” said the Doctor, entering the dark room at the moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am quite glad you are at home; for these hurries and forebodings by\n",
      "which I have been surrounded all day long, have made me nervous without\n",
      "reason. You are not going out, I hope?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No; I am going to play backgammon with you, if you like,” said the\n",
      "Doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t think I do like, if I may speak my mind. I am not fit to be\n",
      "pitted against you to-night. Is the teaboard still there, Lucie? I can’t\n",
      "see.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course, it has been kept for you.”\n",
      "\n",

      "otherwise than safe and well here, thank God; but I have been so put out\n",
      "all day, and I am not as young as I was! My tea, my dear! Thank ye. Now,\n",

      "the echoes about which you have your theory.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not a theory; it was a fancy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A fancy, then, my wise pet,” said Mr. Lorry, patting her hand. “They\n",
      "are very numerous and very loud, though, are they not? Only hear them!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Headlong, mad, and dangerous footsteps to force their way into anybody’s\n",
      "life, footsteps not easily made clean again if once stained red, the\n",
      "footsteps raging in Saint Antoine afar off, as the little circle sat in\n",
      "the dark London window.\n",
      "\n",
      "Saint Antoine had been, that morning, a vast dusky mass of scarecrows\n",
      "heaving to and fro, with frequent gleams of light above the billowy\n",
      "heads, where steel blades and bayonets shone in the sun. A tremendous\n",
      "roar arose from the throat of Saint Antoine, and a forest of naked arms\n",
      "struggled in the air like shrivelled branches of trees in a winter wind:\n",
      "all the fingers convulsively clutching at every weapon or semblance of a\n",
      "weapon that was thrown up from the depths below, no matter how far off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who gave them out, whence they last came, where they began, through what\n",
      "agency they crookedly quivered and jerked, scores at a time, over the\n",
      "heads of the crowd, like a kind of lightning, no eye in the throng could\n",
      "have told; but, muskets were being distributed--so were cartridges,\n",
      "powder, and ball, bars of iron and wood, knives, axes, pikes, every\n",
      "weapon that distracted ingenuity could discover or devise. People who\n",
      "could lay hold of nothing else, set themselves with bleeding hands to\n",
      "force stones and bricks out of their places in walls. Every pulse and\n",
      "heart in Saint Antoine was on high-fever strain and at high-fever heat.\n",
      "Every living creature there held life as of no account, and was demented\n",
      "with a passionate readiness to sacrifice it.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a whirlpool of boiling waters has a centre point, so, all this raging\n",
      "circled round Defarge’s wine-shop, and every human drop in the caldron\n",
      "had a tendency to be sucked towards the vortex where Defarge himself,\n",
      "already begrimed with gunpowder and sweat, issued orders, issued arms,\n",
      "thrust this man back, dragged this man forward, disarmed one to arm\n",
      "another, laboured and strove in the thickest of the uproar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Keep near to me, Jacques Three,” cried Defarge; “and do you, Jacques\n",
      "One and Two, separate and put yourselves at the head of as many of these\n",
      "patriots as you can. Where is my wife?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Eh, well! Here you see me!” said madame, composed as ever, but not\n",
      "knitting to-day. Madame’s resolute right hand was occupied with an axe,\n",
      "in place of the usual softer implements, and in her girdle were a pistol\n",

      "\n",
      "With a roar that sounded as if all the breath in France had been shaped\n",
      "into the detested word, the living sea rose, wave on wave, depth on\n",
      "depth, and overflowed the city to that point. Alarm-bells ringing, drums\n",
      "beating, the sea raging and thundering on its new beach, the attack\n",
      "began.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deep ditches, double drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great\n",
      "towers, cannon, muskets, fire and smoke. Through the fire and through\n",

      "the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations, when Madame\n",

      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge, with her arms folded, sat in the morning light and heat,\n",
      "contemplating the wine-shop and the street. In both, there were several\n",
      "knots of loungers, squalid and miserable, but now with a manifest sense\n",
      "of power enthroned on their distress. The raggedest nightcap, awry on\n",
      "the wretchedest head, had this crooked significance in it: “I know how\n",

      "before, had this work always ready for it now, that it could strike.\n",

      "The Vengeance, uttering terrific shrieks, and flinging her arms about\n",
      "her head like all the forty Furies at once, was tearing from house to\n",

      "The men were terrible, in the bloody-minded anger with which they looked\n",
      "from windows, caught up what arms they had, and came pouring down into\n",
      "the streets; but, the women were a sight to chill the boldest. From\n",
      "such household occupations as their bare poverty yielded, from their\n",
      "children, from their aged and their sick crouching on the bare ground\n",
      "famished and naked, they ran out with streaming hair, urging one\n",
      "another, and themselves, to madness with the wildest cries and actions.\n",
      "Villain Foulon taken, my sister! Old Foulon taken, my mother! Miscreant\n",
      "Foulon taken, my daughter! Then, a score of others ran into the midst of\n",

      "alive! Foulon who told the starving people they might eat grass! Foulon\n",

      "Foulon to pieces, and dig him into the ground, that grass may grow from\n",
      "him! With these cries, numbers of the women, lashed into blind frenzy,\n",
      "whirled about, striking and tearing at their own friends until they\n",
      "dropped into a passionate swoon, and were only saved by the men\n",
      "belonging to them from being trampled under foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, not a moment was lost; not a moment! This Foulon was at\n",
      "the Hotel de Ville, and might be loosed. Never, if Saint Antoine knew\n",
      "his own sufferings, insults, and wrongs! Armed men and women flocked out\n",
      "of the Quarter so fast, and drew even these last dregs after them with\n",
      "such a force of suction, that within a quarter of an hour there was not\n",

      "him!\n",
      "\n",
      "It was known directly, to the furthest confines of the crowd. Defarge\n",

      "her hand in one of the ropes with which he was tied--The Vengeance and\n",
      "Jacques Three were not yet up with them, and the men at the windows\n",
      "had not yet swooped into the Hall, like birds of prey from their high\n",
      "perches--when the cry seemed to go up, all over the city, “Bring him\n",

      "by silver gleams upon the landscape, the little man (who wore a red cap\n",
      "now, in place of his blue one) seemed fascinated by the figure on the\n",
      "heap of stones. His eyes were so often turned towards it, that he used\n",
      "his tools mechanically, and, one would have said, to very poor account.\n",
      "The bronze face, the shaggy black hair and beard, the coarse woollen\n",
      "red cap, the rough medley dress of home-spun stuff and hairy skins of\n",
      "beasts, the powerful frame attenuated by spare living, and the sullen\n",
      "and desperate compression of the lips in sleep, inspired the mender\n",
      "of roads with awe. The traveller had travelled far, and his feet were\n",
      "footsore, and his ankles chafed and bleeding; his great shoes, stuffed\n",
      "with leaves and grass, had been heavy to drag over the many long\n",
      "leagues, and his clothes were chafed into holes, as he himself was into\n",
      "sores. Stooping down beside him, the road-mender tried to get a peep at\n",
      "secret weapons in his breast or where not; but, in vain, for he slept\n",
      "with his arms crossed upon him, and set as resolutely as his lips.\n",
      "Fortified towns with their stockades, guard-houses, gates, trenches, and\n",
      "drawbridges, seemed to the mender of roads, to be so much air as against\n",
      "this figure. And when he lifted his eyes from it to the horizon and\n",
      "looked around, he saw in his small fancy similar figures, stopped by no\n",
      "obstacle, tending to centres all over France.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man slept on, indifferent to showers of hail and intervals of\n",
      "brightness, to sunshine on his face and shadow, to the paltering lumps\n",
      "of dull ice on his body and the diamonds into which the sun changed\n",
      "them, until the sun was low in the west, and the sky was glowing. Then,\n",
      "the mender of roads having got his tools together and all things ready\n",
      "to go down into the village, roused him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good!” said the sleeper, rising on his elbow. “Two leagues beyond the\n",

      "The mender of roads went home, with the dust going on before him\n",
      "according to the set of the wind, and was soon at the fountain,\n",
      "squeezing himself in among the lean kine brought there to drink, and\n",
      "appearing even to whisper to them in his whispering to all the village.\n",
      "When the village had taken its poor supper, it did not creep to bed,\n",
      "as it usually did, but came out of doors again, and remained there. A\n",
      "curious contagion of whispering was upon it, and also, when it gathered\n",
      "together at the fountain in the dark, another curious contagion of\n",
      "looking expectantly at the sky in one direction only. Monsieur Gabelle,\n",
      "chief functionary of the place, became uneasy; went out on his house-top\n",
      "alone, and looked in that direction too; glanced down from behind his\n",
      "chimneys at the darkening faces by the fountain below, and sent word to\n",
      "the sacristan who kept the keys of the church, that there might be need\n",
      "to ring the tocsin by-and-bye.\n",
      "\n",
      "The night deepened. The trees environing the old chateau, keeping its\n",
      "solitary state apart, moved in a rising wind, as though they threatened\n",
      "the pile of building massive and dark in the gloom. Up the two terrace\n",
      "flights of steps the rain ran wildly, and beat at the great door, like a\n",
      "swift messenger rousing those within; uneasy rushes of wind went through\n",
      "the hall, among the old spears and knives, and passed lamenting up the\n",
      "stairs, and shook the curtains of the bed where the last Marquis\n",
      "had slept. East, West, North, and South, through the woods, four\n",
      "heavy-treading, unkempt figures crushed the high grass and cracked the\n",
      "branches, striding on cautiously to come together in the courtyard. Four\n",
      "lights broke out there, and moved away in different directions, and all\n",
      "was black again.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, not for long. Presently, the chateau began to make itself strangely\n",
      "visible by some light of its own, as though it were growing luminous.\n",
      "Then, a flickering streak played behind the architecture of the front,\n",
      "picking out transparent places, and showing where balustrades, arches,\n",
      "and windows were. Then it soared higher, and grew broader and brighter.\n",
      "Soon, from a score of the great windows, flames burst forth, and the\n",
      "stone faces awakened, stared out of fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "A faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who were left\n",
      "there, and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away. There was\n",
      "spurring and splashing through the darkness, and bridle was drawn in the\n",
      "space by the village fountain, and the horse in a foam stood at Monsieur\n",
      "Gabelle’s door. “Help, Gabelle! Help, every one!” The tocsin rang\n",
      "impatiently, but other help (if that were any) there was none. The\n",
      "mender of roads, and two hundred and fifty particular friends, stood\n",
      "with folded arms at the fountain, looking at the pillar of fire in the\n",
      "sky. “It must be forty feet high,” said they, grimly; and never moved.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rider from the chateau, and the horse in a foam, clattered away\n",
      "through the village, and galloped up the stony steep, to the prison on\n",
      "the crag. At the gate, a group of officers were looking at the fire;\n",
      "removed from them, a group of soldiers. “Help, gentlemen--officers! The\n",
      "chateau is on fire; valuable objects may be saved from the flames by\n",
      "timely aid! Help, help!” The officers looked towards the soldiers who\n",
      "looked at the fire; gave no orders; and answered, with shrugs and biting\n",
      "of lips, “It must burn.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street, the\n",
      "village was illuminating. The mender of roads, and the two hundred and\n",
      "fifty particular friends, inspired as one man and woman by the idea of\n",
      "lighting up, had darted into their houses, and were putting candles in\n",
      "every dull little pane of glass. The general scarcity of everything,\n",
      "occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of\n",
      "Monsieur Gabelle; and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on\n",
      "that functionary’s part, the mender of roads, once so submissive to\n",
      "authority, had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with,\n",
      "and that post-horses would roast.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chateau was left to itself to flame and burn. In the roaring and\n",
      "raging of the conflagration, a red-hot wind, driving straight from the\n",
      "infernal regions, seemed to be blowing the edifice away. With the rising\n",
      "and falling of the blaze, the stone faces showed as if they were in\n",
      "torment. When great masses of stone and timber fell, the face with the\n",
      "two dints in the nose became obscured: anon struggled out of the smoke\n",
      "again, as if it were the face of the cruel Marquis, burning at the stake\n",
      "and contending with the fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chateau burned; the nearest trees, laid hold of by the fire,\n",
      "scorched and shrivelled; trees at a distance, fired by the four fierce\n",
      "figures, begirt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke. Molten\n",
      "lead and iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain; the water ran\n",
      "dry; the extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before the\n",
      "heat, and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame. Great rents and\n",
      "splits branched out in the solid walls, like crystallisation; stupefied\n",
      "birds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace; four fierce figures\n",
      "trudged away, East, West, North, and South, along the night-enshrouded\n",
      "roads, guided by the beacon they had lighted, towards their next\n",
      "destination. The illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin, and,\n",
      "abolishing the lawful ringer, rang for joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only that; but the village, light-headed with famine, fire, and\n",
      "bell-ringing, and bethinking itself that Monsieur Gabelle had to do with\n",
      "the collection of rent and taxes--though it was but a small instalment\n",
      "of taxes, and no rent at all, that Gabelle had got in those latter\n",
      "days--became impatient for an interview with him, and, surrounding his\n",
      "house, summoned him to come forth for personal conference. Whereupon,\n",
      "Monsieur Gabelle did heavily bar his door, and retire to hold counsel\n",
      "with himself. The result of that conference was, that Gabelle again\n",
      "withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys; this time\n",
      "resolved, if his door were broken in (he was a small Southern man\n",
      "of retaliative temperament), to pitch himself head foremost over the\n",
      "parapet, and crush a man or two below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Probably, Monsieur Gabelle passed a long night up there, with the\n",
      "distant chateau for fire and candle, and the beating at his door,\n",
      "combined with the joy-ringing, for music; not to mention his having an\n",
      "ill-omened lamp slung across the road before his posting-house gate,\n",
      "which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour.\n",
      "A trying suspense, to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of\n",
      "the black ocean, ready to take that plunge into it upon which Monsieur\n",
      "Gabelle had resolved! But, the friendly dawn appearing at last, and the\n",

      "to itself, and he must go. Everything that arose before his mind drifted\n",
      "him on, faster and faster, more and more steadily, to the terrible\n",
      "attraction. His latent uneasiness had been, that bad aims were being\n",
      "worked out in his own unhappy land by bad instruments, and that he who\n",
      "could not fail to know that he was better than they, was not there,\n",
      "trying to do something to stay bloodshed, and assert the claims of mercy\n",
      "and humanity. With this uneasiness half stifled, and half reproaching\n",
      "him, he had been brought to the pointed comparison of himself with the\n",
      "brave old gentleman in whom duty was so strong; upon that comparison\n",
      "(injurious to himself) had instantly followed the sneers of Monseigneur,\n",
      "which had stung him bitterly, and those of Stryver, which above all were\n",
      "coarse and galling, for old reasons. Upon those, had followed Gabelle’s\n",
      "letter: the appeal of an innocent prisoner, in danger of death, to his\n",
      "justice, honour, and good name.\n",
      "\n",
      "His resolution was made. He must go to Paris.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. The Loadstone Rock was drawing him, and he must sail on, until he\n",
      "struck. He knew of no rock; he saw hardly any danger. The intention\n",
      "with which he had done what he had done, even although he had left\n",
      "it incomplete, presented it before him in an aspect that would be\n",
      "gratefully acknowledged in France on his presenting himself to assert\n",
      "it. Then, that glorious vision of doing good, which is so often the\n",
      "sanguine mirage of so many good minds, arose before him, and he even\n",
      "saw himself in the illusion with some influence to guide this raging\n",
      "Revolution that was running so fearfully wild.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he walked to and fro with his resolution made, he considered that\n",
      "neither Lucie nor her father must know of it until he was gone.\n",
      "Lucie should be spared the pain of separation; and her father, always\n",
      "reluctant to turn his thoughts towards the dangerous ground of old,\n",
      "should come to the knowledge of the step, as a step taken, and not in\n",
      "the balance of suspense and doubt. How much of the incompleteness of his\n",
      "situation was referable to her father, through the painful anxiety\n",
      "to avoid reviving old associations of France in his mind, he did not\n",
      "discuss with himself. But, that circumstance too, had had its influence\n",
      "in his course.\n",
      "\n",
      "He walked to and fro, with thoughts very busy, until it was time to\n",
      "return to Tellson’s and take leave of Mr. Lorry. As soon as he arrived\n",
      "in Paris he would present himself to this old friend, but he must say\n",
      "nothing of his intention now.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Gabelle. And what is the message to the unfortunate Gabelle in prison?”\n",

      "he was under to go to Paris, and showing her, at length, the reasons\n",
      "that he had, for feeling confident that he could become involved in no\n",
      "personal danger there; the other was to the Doctor, confiding Lucie and\n",
      "their dear child to his care, and dwelling on the same topics with the\n",
      "strongest assurances. To both, he wrote that he would despatch letters\n",
      "in proof of his safety, immediately after his arrival.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a hard day, that day of being among them, with the first\n",

      "But, an affectionate glance at his wife, so happy and busy, made him\n",
      "resolute not to tell her what impended (he had been half moved to do it,\n",
      "so strange it was to him to act in anything without her quiet aid), and\n",
      "the day passed quickly. Early in the evening he embraced her, and her\n",
      "scarcely less dear namesake, pretending that he would return by-and-bye\n",
      "(an imaginary engagement took him out, and he had secreted a valise\n",

      "\n",
      "The unseen force was drawing him fast to itself, now, and all the tides\n",
      "and winds were setting straight and strong towards it. He left his\n",

      "unfortunate King of France had been upon his throne in all his glory;\n",

      "of readiness, who stopped all comers and goers, cross-questioned them,\n",

      "A very few French leagues of his journey were accomplished, when Charles\n",
      "Darnay began to perceive that for him along these country roads there\n",
      "was no hope of return until he should have been declared a good citizen\n",
      "at Paris. Whatever might befall now, he must on to his journey’s end.\n",
      "Not a mean village closed upon him, not a common barrier dropped across\n",
      "the road behind him, but he knew it to be another iron door in\n",
      "the series that was barred between him and England. The universal\n",
      "watchfulness so encompassed him, that if he had been taken in a net,\n",
      "or were being forwarded to his destination in a cage, he could not have\n",
      "felt his freedom more completely gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "This universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highway twenty\n",
      "times in a stage, but retarded his progress twenty times in a day, by\n",
      "riding after him and taking him back, riding before him and stopping him\n",
      "by anticipation, riding with him and keeping him in charge. He had been\n",
      "days upon his journey in France alone, when he went to bed tired out, in\n",
      "a little town on the high road, still a long way from Paris.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing but the production of the afflicted Gabelle’s letter from his\n",
      "prison of the Abbaye would have got him on so far. His difficulty at the\n",
      "guard-house in this small place had been such, that he felt his journey\n",
      "to have come to a crisis. And he was, therefore, as little surprised as\n",
      "a man could be, to find himself awakened at the small inn to which he\n",
      "had been remitted until morning, in the middle of the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Awakened by a timid local functionary and three armed patriots in rough\n",
      "red caps and with pipes in their mouths, who sat down on the bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Emigrant,” said the functionary, “I am going to send you on to Paris,\n",
      "under an escort.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Citizen, I desire nothing more than to get to Paris, though I could\n",
      "dispense with the escort.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Silence!” growled a red-cap, striking at the coverlet with the butt-end\n",
      "of his musket. “Peace, aristocrat!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is as the good patriot says,” observed the timid functionary. “You\n",
      "are an aristocrat, and must have an escort--and must pay for it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have no choice,” said Charles Darnay.\n",
      "\n",

      "not a favour to be protected from the lamp-iron!”\n",

      "“It is always as the good patriot says,” observed the functionary. “Rise\n",
      "and dress yourself, emigrant.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Darnay complied, and was taken back to the guard-house, where other\n",
      "patriots in rough red caps were smoking, drinking, and sleeping, by\n",
      "a watch-fire. Here he paid a heavy price for his escort, and hence he\n",
      "started with it on the wet, wet roads at three o’clock in the morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tri-coloured\n",
      "cockades, armed with national muskets and sabres, who rode one on either\n",
      "side of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The escorted governed his own horse, but a loose line was attached to\n",
      "his bridle, the end of which one of the patriots kept girded round his\n",
      "wrist. In this state they set forth with the sharp rain driving in their\n",
      "faces: clattering at a heavy dragoon trot over the uneven town pavement,\n",
      "and out upon the mire-deep roads. In this state they traversed without\n",
      "change, except of horses and pace, all the mire-deep leagues that lay\n",
      "between them and the capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "They travelled in the night, halting an hour or two after daybreak, and\n",
      "lying by until the twilight fell. The escort were so wretchedly clothed,\n",
      "that they twisted straw round their bare legs, and thatched their ragged\n",
      "shoulders to keep the wet off. Apart from the personal discomfort of\n",
      "being so attended, and apart from such considerations of present danger\n",
      "as arose from one of the patriots being chronically drunk, and carrying\n",
      "his musket very recklessly, Charles Darnay did not allow the restraint\n",
      "that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears in his breast; for,\n",
      "he reasoned with himself that it could have no reference to the merits\n",
      "of an individual case that was not yet stated, and of representations,\n",
      "confirmable by the prisoner in the Abbaye, that were not yet made.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when they came to the town of Beauvais--which they did at eventide,\n",
      "when the streets were filled with people--he could not conceal from\n",
      "himself that the aspect of affairs was very alarming. An ominous crowd\n",
      "gathered to see him dismount of the posting-yard, and many voices called\n",
      "out loudly, “Down with the emigrant!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped in the act of swinging himself out of his saddle, and,\n",
      "resuming it as his safest place, said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Emigrant, my friends! Do you not see me here, in France, of my own\n",
      "will?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are a cursed emigrant,” cried a farrier, making at him in a\n",
      "furious manner through the press, hammer in hand; “and you are a cursed\n",
      "aristocrat!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The postmaster interposed himself between this man and the rider’s\n",
      "bridle (at which he was evidently making), and soothingly said, “Let him\n",
      "be; let him be! He will be judged at Paris.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Judged!” repeated the farrier, swinging his hammer. “Ay! and condemned\n",
      "as a traitor.” At this the crowd roared approval.\n",
      "\n",
      "Checking the postmaster, who was for turning his horse’s head to the\n",
      "yard (the drunken patriot sat composedly in his saddle looking on, with\n",
      "the line round his wrist), Darnay said, as soon as he could make his\n",
      "voice heard:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Friends, you deceive yourselves, or you are deceived. I am not a\n",
      "traitor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He lies!” cried the smith. “He is a traitor since the decree. His life\n",
      "is forfeit to the people. His cursed life is not his own!”\n",
      "\n",
      "At the instant when Darnay saw a rush in the eyes of the crowd, which\n",
      "another instant would have brought upon him, the postmaster turned his\n",
      "horse into the yard, the escort rode in close upon his horse’s flanks,\n",
      "and the postmaster shut and barred the crazy double gates. The farrier\n",
      "struck a blow upon them with his hammer, and the crowd groaned; but, no\n",
      "more was done.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is this decree that the smith spoke of?” Darnay asked the\n",
      "postmaster, when he had thanked him, and stood beside him in the yard.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Truly, a decree for selling the property of emigrants.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“When passed?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“On the fourteenth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The day I left England!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Everybody says it is but one of several, and that there will be\n",
      "others--if there are not already--banishing all emigrants, and\n",
      "condemning all to death who return. That is what he meant when he said\n",
      "your life was not your own.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But there are no such decrees yet?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do I know!” said the postmaster, shrugging his shoulders; “there\n",
      "may be, or there will be. It is all the same. What would you have?”\n",
      "\n",
      "They rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night, and\n",
      "then rode forward again when all the town was asleep. Among the many\n",
      "wild changes observable on familiar things which made this wild ride\n",
      "unreal, not the least was the seeming rarity of sleep. After long and\n",
      "lonely spurring over dreary roads, they would come to a cluster of poor\n",
      "cottages, not steeped in darkness, but all glittering with lights, and\n",
      "would find the people, in a ghostly manner in the dead of the night,\n",
      "circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of Liberty, or all drawn\n",
      "up together singing a Liberty song. Happily, however, there was sleep in\n",
      "Beauvais that night to help them out of it and they passed on once more\n",
      "into solitude and loneliness: jingling through the untimely cold and\n",
      "wet, among impoverished fields that had yielded no fruits of the earth\n",
      "that year, diversified by the blackened remains of burnt houses, and by\n",
      "the sudden emergence from ambuscade, and sharp reining up across their\n",
      "way, of patriot patrols on the watch on all the roads.\n",
      "\n",
      "Daylight at last found them before the wall of Paris. The barrier was\n",
      "closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where are the papers of this prisoner?” demanded a resolute-looking man\n",
      "in authority, who was summoned out by the guard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Naturally struck by the disagreeable word, Charles Darnay requested the\n",
      "speaker to take notice that he was a free traveller and French citizen,\n",
      "in charge of an escort which the disturbed state of the country had\n",
      "imposed upon him, and which he had paid for.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where,” repeated the same personage, without taking any heed of him\n",
      "whatever, “are the papers of this prisoner?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The drunken patriot had them in his cap, and produced them. Casting his\n",
      "eyes over Gabelle’s letter, the same personage in authority showed some\n",
      "disorder and surprise, and looked at Darnay with a close attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "He left escort and escorted without saying a word, however, and went\n",
      "into the guard-room; meanwhile, they sat upon their horses outside the\n",
      "gate. Looking about him while in this state of suspense, Charles\n",
      "Darnay observed that the gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers and\n",
      "patriots, the latter far outnumbering the former; and that while ingress\n",
      "into the city for peasants’ carts bringing in supplies, and for similar\n",
      "traffic and traffickers, was easy enough, egress, even for the homeliest\n",
      "people, was very difficult. A numerous medley of men and women, not\n",
      "to mention beasts and vehicles of various sorts, was waiting to issue\n",
      "forth; but, the previous identification was so strict, that they\n",
      "filtered through the barrier very slowly. Some of these people knew\n",
      "their turn for examination to be so far off, that they lay down on the\n",
      "ground to sleep or smoke, while others talked together, or loitered\n",
      "about. The red cap and tri-colour cockade were universal, both among men\n",
      "and women.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had sat in his saddle some half-hour, taking note of these\n",
      "things, Darnay found himself confronted by the same man in authority,\n",
      "who directed the guard to open the barrier. Then he delivered to the\n",
      "escort, drunk and sober, a receipt for the escorted, and requested him\n",
      "to dismount. He did so, and the two patriots, leading his tired horse,\n",
      "turned and rode away without entering the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "He accompanied his conductor into a guard-room, smelling of common wine\n",
      "and tobacco, where certain soldiers and patriots, asleep and awake,\n",
      "drunk and sober, and in various neutral states between sleeping and\n",
      "waking, drunkenness and sobriety, were standing and lying about. The\n",
      "light in the guard-house, half derived from the waning oil-lamps of\n",
      "the night, and half from the overcast day, was in a correspondingly\n",
      "uncertain condition. Some registers were lying open on a desk, and an\n",
      "officer of a coarse, dark aspect, presided over these.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Citizen Defarge,” said he to Darnay’s conductor, as he took a slip of\n",
      "paper to write on. “Is this the emigrant Evrémonde?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is the man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your age, Evrémonde?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thirty-seven.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Married, Evrémonde?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where married?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In England.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Without doubt. Where is your wife, Evrémonde?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In England.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Without doubt. You are consigned, Evrémonde, to the prison of La\n",
      "Force.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just Heaven!” exclaimed Darnay. “Under what law, and for what offence?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have new laws, Evrémonde, and new offences, since you were here.” He\n",
      "said it with a hard smile, and went on writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I entreat you to observe that I have come here voluntarily, in response\n",
      "to that written appeal of a fellow-countryman which lies before you. I\n",
      "demand no more than the opportunity to do so without delay. Is not that\n",
      "my right?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Emigrants have no rights, Evrémonde,” was the stolid reply. The officer\n",
      "wrote until he had finished, read over to himself what he had written,\n",
      "sanded it, and handed it to Defarge, with the words “In secret.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Defarge motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he must accompany\n",
      "him. The prisoner obeyed, and a guard of two armed patriots attended\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it you,” said Defarge, in a low voice, as they went down the\n",

      "\n",
      "“Indeed I am lost here. All here is so unprecedented, so changed, so\n",
      "sudden and unfair, that I am absolutely lost. Will you render me a\n",

      "\n",

      "and set silence. The deeper he sank into this silence, the fainter hope\n",
      "there was--or so Darnay thought--of his softening in any slight degree.\n",

      "than I, of how much importance), that I should be able to communicate to\n",
      "Mr. Lorry of Tellson’s Bank, an English gentleman who is now in Paris,\n",

      "I will do nothing for you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Charles Darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further, and his pride\n",
      "was touched besides. As they walked on in silence, he could not but see\n",
      "how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the\n",
      "streets. The very children scarcely noticed him. A few passers turned\n",
      "their heads, and a few shook their fingers at him as an aristocrat;\n",
      "otherwise, that a man in good clothes should be going to prison, was no\n",
      "more remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be\n",
      "going to work. In one narrow, dark, and dirty street through which they\n",
      "passed, an excited orator, mounted on a stool, was addressing an excited\n",
      "audience on the crimes against the people, of the king and the royal\n",
      "family. The few words that he caught from this man’s lips, first made\n",
      "it known to Charles Darnay that the king was in prison, and that the\n",
      "foreign ambassadors had one and all left Paris. On the road (except at\n",
      "Beauvais) he had heard absolutely nothing. The escort and the universal\n",
      "watchfulness had completely isolated him.\n",
      "\n",
      "That he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had\n",
      "developed themselves when he left England, he of course knew now. That\n",
      "perils had thickened about him fast, and might thicken faster and faster\n",
      "yet, he of course knew now. He could not but admit to himself that he\n",
      "might not have made this journey, if he could have foreseen the events\n",
      "of a few days. And yet his misgivings were not so dark as, imagined by\n",
      "the light of this later time, they would appear. Troubled as the future\n",
      "was, it was the unknown future, and in its obscurity there was ignorant\n",
      "hope. The horrible massacre, days and nights long, which, within a few\n",
      "rounds of the clock, was to set a great mark of blood upon the blessed\n",
      "garnering time of harvest, was as far out of his knowledge as if it had\n",
      "been a hundred thousand years away. The “sharp female newly-born, and\n",
      "called La Guillotine,” was hardly known to him, or to the generality\n",
      "of people, by name. The frightful deeds that were to be soon done, were\n",
      "probably unimagined at that time in the brains of the doers. How could\n",
      "they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind?\n",
      "\n",
      "Of unjust treatment in detention and hardship, and in cruel separation\n",
      "from his wife and child, he foreshadowed the likelihood, or the\n",
      "certainty; but, beyond this, he dreaded nothing distinctly. With this on\n",
      "his mind, which was enough to carry into a dreary prison courtyard, he\n",
      "arrived at the prison of La Force.\n",
      "\n",
      "A man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket, to whom Defarge\n",
      "presented “The Emigrant Evrémonde.”\n",

      "with his two fellow-patriots.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What the Devil, I say again!” exclaimed the gaoler, left with his wife.\n",
      "“How many more!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The gaoler’s wife, being provided with no answer to the question, merely\n",
      "replied, “One must have patience, my dear!” Three turnkeys who entered\n",
      "responsive to a bell she rang, echoed the sentiment, and one added, “For\n",
      "the love of Liberty;” which sounded in that place like an inappropriate\n",
      "conclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prison of La Force was a gloomy prison, dark and filthy, and with a\n",
      "horrible smell of foul sleep in it. Extraordinary how soon the noisome\n",
      "flavour of imprisoned sleep, becomes manifest in all such places that\n",
      "are ill cared for!\n",
      "\n",
      "“In secret, too,” grumbled the gaoler, looking at the written paper. “As\n",
      "if I was not already full to bursting!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He stuck the paper on a file, in an ill-humour, and Charles Darnay\n",
      "awaited his further pleasure for half an hour: sometimes, pacing to and\n",
      "fro in the strong arched room: sometimes, resting on a stone seat: in\n",
      "either case detained to be imprinted on the memory of the chief and his\n",
      "subordinates.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come!” said the chief, at length taking up his keys, “come with me,\n",

      "\n",
      "Through the dismal prison twilight, his new charge accompanied him by\n",
      "corridor and staircase, many doors clanging and locking behind them,\n",
      "until they came into a large, low, vaulted chamber, crowded with\n",
      "prisoners of both sexes. The women were seated at a long table, reading\n",
      "and writing, knitting, sewing, and embroidering; the men were for the\n",
      "most part standing behind their chairs, or lingering up and down the\n",
      "room.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crime and\n",
      "disgrace, the new-comer recoiled from this company. But the crowning\n",
      "unreality of his long unreal ride, was, their all at once rising to\n",
      "receive him, with every refinement of manner known to the time, and with\n",
      "all the engaging graces and courtesies of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "So strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison manners and\n",
      "gloom, so spectral did they become in the inappropriate squalor and\n",
      "misery through which they were seen, that Charles Darnay seemed to stand\n",
      "in a company of the dead. Ghosts all! The ghost of beauty, the ghost\n",
      "of stateliness, the ghost of elegance, the ghost of pride, the ghost of\n",
      "frivolity, the ghost of wit, the ghost of youth, the ghost of age, all\n",
      "waiting their dismissal from the desolate shore, all turning on him eyes\n",
      "that were changed by the death they had died in coming there.\n",
      "\n",
      "It struck him motionless. The gaoler standing at his side, and the other\n",
      "gaolers moving about, who would have been well enough as to appearance\n",
      "in the ordinary exercise of their functions, looked so extravagantly\n",
      "coarse contrasted with sorrowing mothers and blooming daughters who were\n",
      "there--with the apparitions of the coquette, the young beauty, and the\n",
      "mature woman delicately bred--that the inversion of all experience and\n",
      "likelihood which the scene of shadows presented, was heightened to its\n",
      "utmost. Surely, ghosts all. Surely, the long unreal ride some progress\n",
      "of disease that had brought him to these gloomy shades!\n",
      "\n",
      "“In the name of the assembled companions in misfortune,” said a\n",
      "gentleman of courtly appearance and address, coming forward, “I have the\n",
      "honour of giving you welcome to La Force, and of condoling with you\n",
      "on the calamity that has brought you among us. May it soon terminate\n",
      "happily! It would be an impertinence elsewhere, but it is not so here,\n",
      "to ask your name and condition?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Charles Darnay roused himself, and gave the required information, in\n",
      "words as suitable as he could find.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I hope,” said the gentleman, following the chief gaoler with his\n",
      "eyes, who moved across the room, “that you are not in secret?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not understand the meaning of the term, but I have heard them say\n",
      "so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, what a pity! We so much regret it! But take courage; several\n",
      "members of our society have been in secret, at first, and it has lasted\n",
      "but a short time.” Then he added, raising his voice, “I grieve to inform\n",
      "the society--in secret.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a murmur of commiseration as Charles Darnay crossed the room\n",
      "to a grated door where the gaoler awaited him, and many voices--among\n",
      "which, the soft and compassionate voices of women were conspicuous--gave\n",
      "him good wishes and encouragement. He turned at the grated door, to\n",
      "render the thanks of his heart; it closed under the gaoler’s hand; and\n",
      "the apparitions vanished from his sight forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wicket opened on a stone staircase, leading upward. When they had\n",
      "ascended forty steps (the prisoner of half an hour already counted\n",
      "them), the gaoler opened a low black door, and they passed into a\n",
      "solitary cell. It struck cold and damp, but was not dark.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yours,” said the gaoler.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why am I confined alone?”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Such are not my orders. You will be visited, and can ask then. At\n",
      "present, you may buy your food, and nothing more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There were in the cell, a chair, a table, and a straw mattress. As\n",
      "the gaoler made a general inspection of these objects, and of the four\n",
      "walls, before going out, a wandering fancy wandered through the mind of\n",
      "the prisoner leaning against the wall opposite to him, that this gaoler\n",
      "was so unwholesomely bloated, both in face and person, as to look like\n",
      "a man who had been drowned and filled with water. When the gaoler was\n",
      "gone, he thought in the same wandering way, “Now am I left, as if I were\n",
      "dead.” Stopping then, to look down at the mattress, he turned from it\n",
      "with a sick feeling, and thought, “And here in these crawling creatures\n",
      "is the first condition of the body after death.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Five paces by four and a half, five paces by four and a half, five\n",
      "paces by four and a half.” The prisoner walked to and fro in his cell,\n",
      "counting its measurement, and the roar of the city arose like muffled\n",
      "drums with a wild swell of voices added to them. “He made shoes, he made\n",
      "shoes, he made shoes.” The prisoner counted the measurement again, and\n",
      "paced faster, to draw his mind with him from that latter repetition.\n",
      "“The ghosts that vanished when the wicket closed. There was one among\n",
      "them, the appearance of a lady dressed in black, who was leaning in the\n",
      "embrasure of a window, and she had a light shining upon her golden\n",
      "hair, and she looked like * * * * Let us ride on again, for God’s sake,\n",
      "through the illuminated villages with the people all awake! * * * * He\n",
      "made shoes, he made shoes, he made shoes. * * * * Five paces by four and\n",
      "a half.” With such scraps tossing and rolling upward from the depths of\n",
      "his mind, the prisoner walked faster and faster, obstinately counting\n",
      "and counting; and the roar of the city changed to this extent--that it\n",
      "still rolled in like muffled drums, but with the wail of voices that he\n",
      "knew, in the swell that rose above them.\n",

      "a great nobleman who had lived in it until he made a flight from the\n",
      "troubles, in his own cook’s dress, and got across the borders. A\n",
      "mere beast of the chase flying from hunters, he was still in his\n",
      "metempsychosis no other than the same Monseigneur, the preparation\n",
      "of whose chocolate for whose lips had once occupied three strong men\n",

      "willing to cut his throat on the altar of the dawning Republic one and\n",
      "indivisible of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, Monseigneur’s\n",
      "house had been first sequestrated, and then confiscated. For, all\n",
      "things moved so fast, and decree followed decree with that fierce\n",
      "precipitation, that now upon the third night of the autumn month\n",
      "of September, patriot emissaries of the law were in possession of\n",
      "Monseigneur’s house, and had marked it with the tri-colour, and were\n",
      "drinking brandy in its state apartments.\n",
      "\n",
      "A place of business in London like Tellson’s place of business in Paris,\n",
      "would soon have driven the House out of its mind and into the Gazette.\n",
      "For, what would staid British responsibility and respectability have\n",
      "said to orange-trees in boxes in a Bank courtyard, and even to a Cupid\n",
      "over the counter? Yet such things were. Tellson’s had whitewashed the\n",
      "Cupid, but he was still to be seen on the ceiling, in the coolest\n",
      "linen, aiming (as he very often does) at money from morning to\n",
      "night. Bankruptcy must inevitably have come of this young Pagan, in\n",
      "Lombard-street, London, and also of a curtained alcove in the rear of\n",
      "the immortal boy, and also of a looking-glass let into the wall, and\n",
      "also of clerks not at all old, who danced in public on the slightest\n",
      "provocation. Yet, a French Tellson’s could get on with these things\n",
      "exceedingly well, and, as long as the times held together, no man had\n",
      "taken fright at them, and drawn out his money.\n",
      "\n",
      "What money would be drawn out of Tellson’s henceforth, and what would\n",

      "and when they should have violently perished; how many accounts with\n",
      "Tellson’s never to be balanced in this world, must be carried over into\n",
      "the next; no man could have said, that night, any more than Mr. Jarvis\n",
      "Lorry could, though he thought heavily of these questions. He sat by\n",
      "a newly-lighted wood fire (the blighted and unfruitful year was\n",
      "prematurely cold), and on his honest and courageous face there was a\n",
      "deeper shade than the pendent lamp could throw, or any object in the\n",
      "room distortedly reflect--a shade of horror.\n",
      "\n",
      "He occupied rooms in the Bank, in his fidelity to the House of which\n",
      "he had grown to be a part, like strong root-ivy. It chanced that they\n",
      "derived a kind of security from the patriotic occupation of the main\n",
      "building, but the true-hearted old gentleman never calculated about\n",
      "that. All such circumstances were indifferent to him, so that he did\n",
      "his duty. On the opposite side of the courtyard, under a colonnade,\n",
      "was extensive standing--for carriages--where, indeed, some carriages\n",
      "of Monseigneur yet stood. Against two of the pillars were fastened two\n",
      "great flaring flambeaux, and in the light of these, standing out in the\n",
      "open air, was a large grindstone: a roughly mounted thing which appeared\n",
      "to have hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring smithy,\n",
      "or other workshop. Rising and looking out of window at these harmless\n",
      "objects, Mr. Lorry shivered, and retired to his seat by the fire. He had\n",
      "opened, not only the glass window, but the lattice blind outside it, and\n",
      "he had closed both again, and he shivered through his frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the streets beyond the high wall and the strong gate, there came\n",
      "the usual night hum of the city, with now and then an indescribable ring\n",
      "in it, weird and unearthly, as if some unwonted sounds of a terrible\n",
      "nature were going up to Heaven.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank God,” said Mr. Lorry, clasping his hands, “that no one near and\n",

      "who are in danger!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon afterwards, the bell at the great gate sounded, and he thought,\n",
      "“They have come back!” and sat listening. But, there was no loud\n",
      "irruption into the courtyard, as he had expected, and he heard the gate\n",
      "clash again, and all was quiet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The nervousness and dread that were upon him inspired that vague\n",
      "uneasiness respecting the Bank, which a great change would naturally\n",
      "awaken, with such feelings roused. It was well guarded, and he got up to\n",
      "go among the trusty people who were watching it, when his door suddenly\n",
      "opened, and two figures rushed in, at sight of which he fell back in\n",
      "amazement.\n",

      "Lucie and her father! Lucie with her arms stretched out to him, and with\n",
      "that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified, that it\n",
      "seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give\n",
      "force and power to it in this one passage of her life.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is this?” cried Mr. Lorry, breathless and confused. “What is the\n",

      "What is it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "With the look fixed upon him, in her paleness and wildness, she panted\n",
      "out in his arms, imploringly, “O my dear friend! My husband!”\n",

      "\n",

      "us; he was stopped at the barrier, and sent to prison.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man uttered an irrepressible cry. Almost at the same moment, the\n",
      "bell of the great gate rang again, and a loud noise of feet and voices\n",
      "came pouring into the courtyard.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is that noise?” said the Doctor, turning towards the window.\n",
      "\n",

      "don’t touch the blind!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Doctor turned, with his hand upon the fastening of the window, and\n",
      "said, with a cool, bold smile:\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear friend, I have a charmed life in this city. I have been\n",
      "a Bastille prisoner. There is no patriot in Paris--in Paris? In\n",
      "France--who, knowing me to have been a prisoner in the Bastille, would\n",
      "touch me, except to overwhelm me with embraces, or carry me in triumph.\n",
      "My old pain has given me a power that has brought us through the\n",
      "barrier, and gained us news of Charles there, and brought us here. I\n",
      "knew it would be so; I knew I could help Charles out of all danger; I\n",
      "told Lucie so.--What is that noise?” His hand was again upon the window.\n",

      "sharpened, were all red with it. Some of the hacked swords were tied to\n",
      "the wrists of those who carried them, with strips of linen and fragments\n",
      "of dress: ligatures various in kind, but all deep of the one colour. And\n",
      "as the frantic wielders of these weapons snatched them from the stream\n",

      "clinging to his hand. Miss Pross had laid the child down on his own\n",
      "bed, and her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty\n",

      "besmeared that he might have been a sorely wounded soldier creeping back\n",
      "to consciousness on a field of slain, was rising from the pavement by\n",
      "the side of the grindstone, and looking about him with a vacant air.\n",
      "Shortly, this worn-out murderer descried in the imperfect light one of\n",
      "the carriages of Monseigneur, and, staggering to that gorgeous vehicle,\n",

      "\n",
      "The great grindstone, Earth, had turned when Mr. Lorry looked out again,\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of Mr.\n",
      "Lorry when business hours came round, was this:--that he had no right to\n",
      "imperil Tellson’s by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under\n",
      "the Bank roof. His own possessions, safety, life, he would have hazarded\n",
      "for Lucie and her child, without a moment’s demur; but the great trust\n",
      "he held was not his own, and as to that business charge he was a strict\n",
      "man of business.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first, his mind reverted to Defarge, and he thought of finding out\n",
      "the wine-shop again and taking counsel with its master in reference to\n",
      "the safest dwelling-place in the distracted state of the city. But, the\n",
      "same consideration that suggested him, repudiated him; he lived in the\n",
      "most violent Quarter, and doubtless was influential there, and deep in\n",
      "its dangerous workings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Noon coming, and the Doctor not returning, and every minute’s delay\n",
      "tending to compromise Tellson’s, Mr. Lorry advised with Lucie. She said\n",
      "that her father had spoken of hiring a lodging for a short term, in that\n",
      "Quarter, near the Banking-house. As there was no business objection to\n",
      "this, and as he foresaw that even if it were all well with Charles, and\n",
      "he were to be released, he could not hope to leave the city, Mr. Lorry\n",
      "went out in quest of such a lodging, and found a suitable one, high up\n",
      "in a removed by-street where the closed blinds in all the other windows\n",
      "of a high melancholy square of buildings marked deserted homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "To this lodging he at once removed Lucie and her child, and Miss Pross:\n",
      "giving them what comfort he could, and much more than he had himself.\n",
      "He left Jerry with them, as a figure to fill a doorway that would bear\n",
      "considerable knocking on the head, and returned to his own occupations.\n",
      "A disturbed and doleful mind he brought to bear upon them, and slowly\n",
      "and heavily the day lagged on with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It wore itself out, and wore him out with it, until the Bank closed. He\n",
      "was again alone in his room of the previous night, considering what to\n",
      "do next, when he heard a foot upon the stair. In a few moments, a\n",
      "man stood in his presence, who, with a keenly observant look at him,\n",
      "addressed him by his name.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your servant,” said Mr. Lorry. “Do you know me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He was a strongly made man with dark curling hair, from forty-five\n",
      "to fifty years of age. For answer he repeated, without any change of\n",
      "emphasis, the words:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you know me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have seen you somewhere.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps at my wine-shop?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Much interested and agitated, Mr. Lorry said: “You come from Doctor\n",
      "Manette?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. I come from Doctor Manette.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And what says he? What does he send me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Defarge gave into his anxious hand, an open scrap of paper. It bore the\n",
      "words in the Doctor’s writing:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “Charles is safe, but I cannot safely leave this place yet.\n",
      "     I have obtained the favour that the bearer has a short note\n",
      "     from Charles to his wife.  Let the bearer see his wife.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was dated from La Force, within an hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Will you accompany me,” said Mr. Lorry, joyfully relieved after reading\n",
      "this note aloud, “to where his wife resides?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” returned Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scarcely noticing as yet, in what a curiously reserved and mechanical\n",
      "way Defarge spoke, Mr. Lorry put on his hat and they went down into the\n",
      "courtyard. There, they found two women; one, knitting.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Madame Defarge, surely!” said Mr. Lorry, who had left her in exactly\n",
      "the same attitude some seventeen years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is she,” observed her husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Does Madame go with us?” inquired Mr. Lorry, seeing that she moved as\n",
      "they moved.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. That she may be able to recognise the faces and know the persons.\n",
      "It is for their safety.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Beginning to be struck by Defarge’s manner, Mr. Lorry looked dubiously\n",
      "at him, and led the way. Both the women followed; the second woman being\n",
      "The Vengeance.\n",
      "\n",
      "They passed through the intervening streets as quickly as they might,\n",
      "ascended the staircase of the new domicile, were admitted by Jerry,\n",
      "and found Lucie weeping, alone. She was thrown into a transport by the\n",
      "tidings Mr. Lorry gave her of her husband, and clasped the hand that\n",
      "delivered his note--little thinking what it had been doing near him in\n",
      "the night, and might, but for a chance, have done to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "     “DEAREST,--Take courage.  I am well, and your father has\n",
      "      influence around me.  You cannot answer this.\n",
      "      Kiss our child for me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That was all the writing. It was so much, however, to her who received\n",
      "it, that she turned from Defarge to his wife, and kissed one of the\n",
      "hands that knitted. It was a passionate, loving, thankful, womanly\n",
      "action, but the hand made no response--dropped cold and heavy, and took\n",
      "to its knitting again.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was something in its touch that gave Lucie a check. She stopped in\n",
      "the act of putting the note in her bosom, and, with her hands yet at her\n",
      "neck, looked terrified at Madame Defarge. Madame Defarge met the lifted\n",
      "eyebrows and forehead with a cold, impassive stare.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear,” said Mr. Lorry, striking in to explain; “there are frequent\n",
      "risings in the streets; and, although it is not likely they will ever\n",
      "trouble you, Madame Defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power\n",
      "to protect at such times, to the end that she may know them--that she\n",
      "may identify them. I believe,” said Mr. Lorry, rather halting in his\n",
      "reassuring words, as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself\n",
      "upon him more and more, “I state the case, Citizen Defarge?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Defarge looked gloomily at his wife, and gave no other answer than a\n",
      "gruff sound of acquiescence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You had better, Lucie,” said Mr. Lorry, doing all he could to\n",
      "propitiate, by tone and manner, “have the dear child here, and our\n",
      "good Pross. Our good Pross, Defarge, is an English lady, and knows no\n",
      "French.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The lady in question, whose rooted conviction that she was more than a\n",
      "match for any foreigner, was not to be shaken by distress and, danger,\n",
      "appeared with folded arms, and observed in English to The Vengeance,\n",
      "whom her eyes first encountered, “Well, I am sure, Boldface! I hope\n",
      "_you_ are pretty well!” She also bestowed a British cough on Madame\n",
      "Defarge; but, neither of the two took much heed of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is that his child?” said Madame Defarge, stopping in her work for the\n",
      "first time, and pointing her knitting-needle at little Lucie as if it\n",
      "were the finger of Fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, madame,” answered Mr. Lorry; “this is our poor prisoner’s darling\n",
      "daughter, and only child.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed to fall so\n",
      "threatening and dark on the child, that her mother instinctively\n",
      "kneeled on the ground beside her, and held her to her breast. The\n",
      "shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed then to fall,\n",
      "threatening and dark, on both the mother and the child.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is enough, my husband,” said Madame Defarge. “I have seen them. We\n",
      "may go.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But, the suppressed manner had enough of menace in it--not visible and\n",
      "presented, but indistinct and withheld--to alarm Lucie into saying, as\n",
      "she laid her appealing hand on Madame Defarge’s dress:\n",
      "\n",
      "“You will be good to my poor husband. You will do him no harm. You will\n",
      "help me to see him if you can?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your husband is not my business here,” returned Madame Defarge, looking\n",
      "down at her with perfect composure. “It is the daughter of your father\n",
      "who is my business here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For my sake, then, be merciful to my husband. For my child’s sake! She\n",
      "will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful. We are more\n",
      "afraid of you than of these others.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge received it as a compliment, and looked at her husband.\n",
      "Defarge, who had been uneasily biting his thumb-nail and looking at her,\n",
      "collected his face into a sterner expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is it that your husband says in that little letter?” asked Madame\n",
      "Defarge, with a lowering smile. “Influence; he says something touching\n",
      "influence?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That my father,” said Lucie, hurriedly taking the paper from her\n",
      "breast, but with her alarmed eyes on her questioner and not on it, “has\n",
      "much influence around him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Surely it will release him!” said Madame Defarge. “Let it do so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“As a wife and mother,” cried Lucie, most earnestly, “I implore you to\n",
      "have pity on me and not to exercise any power that you possess, against\n",
      "my innocent husband, but to use it in his behalf. O sister-woman, think\n",
      "of me. As a wife and mother!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge looked, coldly as ever, at the suppliant, and said,\n",
      "turning to her friend The Vengeance:\n",
      "\n",
      "“The wives and mothers we have been used to see, since we were as little\n",
      "as this child, and much less, have not been greatly considered? We have\n",
      "known _their_ husbands and fathers laid in prison and kept from them,\n",
      "often enough? All our lives, we have seen our sister-women suffer, in\n",
      "themselves and in their children, poverty, nakedness, hunger, thirst,\n",
      "sickness, misery, oppression and neglect of all kinds?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have seen nothing else,” returned The Vengeance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have borne this a long time,” said Madame Defarge, turning her eyes\n",
      "again upon Lucie. “Judge you! Is it likely that the trouble of one wife\n",
      "and mother would be much to us now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She resumed her knitting and went out. The Vengeance followed. Defarge\n",
      "went last, and closed the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Courage, my dear Lucie,” said Mr. Lorry, as he raised her. “Courage,\n",
      "courage! So far all goes well with us--much, much better than it has of\n",
      "late gone with many poor souls. Cheer up, and have a thankful heart.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not thankless, I hope, but that dreadful woman seems to throw a\n",
      "shadow on me and on all my hopes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tut, tut!” said Mr. Lorry; “what is this despondency in the brave\n",
      "little breast? A shadow indeed! No substance in it, Lucie.”\n",

      "the man sitting as President had then informed Doctor Manette that\n",

      "assure himself that his son-in-law was, through no malice or mischance,\n",
      "delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had\n",
      "often drowned the proceedings, that he had obtained the permission, and\n",
      "had remained in that Hall of Blood until the danger was over.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sights he had seen there, with brief snatches of food and sleep by\n",
      "intervals, shall remain untold. The mad joy over the prisoners who were\n",
      "saved, had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against\n",
      "those who were cut to pieces. One prisoner there was, he said, who had\n",
      "been discharged into the street free, but at whom a mistaken savage had\n",
      "thrust a pike as he passed out. Being besought to go to him and dress\n",
      "the wound, the Doctor had passed out at the same gate, and had found him\n",
      "in the arms of a company of Samaritans, who were seated on the bodies\n",
      "of their victims. With an inconsistency as monstrous as anything in this\n",
      "awful nightmare, they had helped the healer, and tended the wounded man\n",
      "with the gentlest solicitude--had made a litter for him and escorted him\n",
      "carefully from the spot--had then caught up their weapons and plunged\n",
      "anew into a butchery so dreadful, that the Doctor had covered his eyes\n",
      "with his hands, and swooned away in the midst of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Mr. Lorry received these confidences, and as he watched the face of\n",
      "his friend now sixty-two years of age, a misgiving arose within him that\n",
      "such dread experiences would revive the old danger.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, he had never seen his friend in his present aspect: he had never\n",
      "at all known him in his present character. For the first time the Doctor\n",
      "felt, now, that his suffering was strength and power. For the first time\n",
      "he felt that in that sharp fire, he had slowly forged the iron which\n",
      "could break the prison door of his daughter’s husband, and deliver him.\n",
      "“It all tended to a good end, my friend; it was not mere waste and ruin.\n",
      "As my beloved child was helpful in restoring me to myself, I will be\n",
      "helpful now in restoring the dearest part of herself to her; by the aid\n",
      "of Heaven I will do it!” Thus, Doctor Manette. And when Jarvis Lorry saw\n",

      "of the man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped, like a\n",
      "clock, for so many years, and then set going again with an energy which\n",
      "had lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness, he believed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Greater things than the Doctor had at that time to contend with, would\n",
      "have yielded before his persevering purpose. While he kept himself\n",
      "in his place, as a physician, whose business was with all degrees\n",
      "of mankind, bond and free, rich and poor, bad and good, he used his\n",
      "personal influence so wisely, that he was soon the inspecting physician\n",
      "of three prisons, and among them of La Force. He could now assure Lucie\n",
      "that her husband was no longer confined alone, but was mixed with the\n",
      "general body of prisoners; he saw her husband weekly, and brought sweet\n",
      "messages to her, straight from his lips; sometimes her husband himself\n",
      "sent a letter to her (though never by the Doctor’s hand), but she was\n",
      "not permitted to write to him: for, among the many wild suspicions of\n",
      "plots in the prisons, the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were\n",
      "known to have made friends or permanent connections abroad.\n",
      "\n",
      "This new life of the Doctor’s was an anxious life, no doubt; still, the\n",
      "sagacious Mr. Lorry saw that there was a new sustaining pride in it.\n",
      "Nothing unbecoming tinged the pride; it was a natural and worthy one;\n",
      "but he observed it as a curiosity. The Doctor knew, that up to that\n",
      "time, his imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his daughter\n",
      "and his friend, with his personal affliction, deprivation, and weakness.\n",
      "Now that this was changed, and he knew himself to be invested through\n",
      "that old trial with forces to which they both looked for Charles’s\n",
      "ultimate safety and deliverance, he became so far exalted by the change,\n",
      "that he took the lead and direction, and required them as the weak, to\n",
      "trust to him as the strong. The preceding relative positions of himself\n",
      "and Lucie were reversed, yet only as the liveliest gratitude and\n",
      "affection could reverse them, for he could have had no pride but in\n",
      "rendering some service to her who had rendered so much to him. “All\n",
      "curious to see,” thought Mr. Lorry, in his amiably shrewd way, “but all\n",
      "natural and right; so, take the lead, my dear friend, and keep it; it\n",
      "couldn’t be in better hands.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But, though the Doctor tried hard, and never ceased trying, to get\n",
      "Charles Darnay set at liberty, or at least to get him brought to trial,\n",
      "the public current of the time set too strong and fast for him. The new\n",
      "era began; the king was tried, doomed, and beheaded; the Republic of\n",
      "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, declared for victory or death\n",
      "against the world in arms; the black flag waved night and day from the\n",
      "great towers of Notre Dame; three hundred thousand men, summoned to rise\n",
      "against the tyrants of the earth, rose from all the varying soils\n",
      "of France, as if the dragon’s teeth had been sown broadcast, and\n",
      "had yielded fruit equally on hill and plain, on rock, in gravel, and\n",
      "alluvial mud, under the bright sky of the South and under the clouds of\n",
      "the North, in fell and forest, in the vineyards and the olive-grounds\n",
      "and among the cropped grass and the stubble of the corn, along the\n",
      "fruitful banks of the broad rivers, and in the sand of the sea-shore.\n",
      "What private solicitude could rear itself against the deluge of the Year\n",

      "count of time there was none. Hold of it was lost in the raging fever\n",
      "of a nation, as it is in the fever of one patient. Now, breaking the\n",

      "shaved close: who kissed La Guillotine, looked through the little window\n",
      "and sneezed into the sack. It was the sign of the regeneration of the\n",
      "human race. It superseded the Cross. Models of it were worn on breasts\n",
      "from which the Cross was discarded, and it was bowed down to and\n",
      "believed in where the Cross was denied.\n",
      "\n",

      "were a rotten red. It was taken to pieces, like a toy-puzzle for a young\n",
      "Devil, and was put together again when the occasion wanted it. It hushed\n",
      "the eloquent, struck down the powerful, abolished the beautiful and\n",
      "good. Twenty-two friends of high public mark, twenty-one living and one\n",

      "current of the time swept by, so strong and deep, and carried the time\n",

      "She did not greatly alter in appearance. The plain dark dresses, akin to\n",

      "attended to as the brighter clothes of happy days. She lost her colour,\n",

      "\n",
      "The dread tribunal of five Judges, Public Prosecutor, and determined\n",
      "Jury, sat every day. Their lists went forth every evening, and were\n",
      "read out by the gaolers of the various prisons to their prisoners. The\n",
      "standard gaoler-joke was, “Come out and listen to the Evening Paper, you\n",
      "inside there!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Charles Evrémonde, called Darnay!”\n",
      "\n",
      "So at last began the Evening Paper at La Force.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a name was called, its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved\n",
      "for those who were announced as being thus fatally recorded. Charles\n",
      "Evrémonde, called Darnay, had reason to know the usage; he had seen\n",
      "hundreds pass away so.\n",
      "\n",
      "His bloated gaoler, who wore spectacles to read with, glanced over them\n",
      "to assure himself that he had taken his place, and went through the\n",
      "list, making a similar short pause at each name. There were twenty-three\n",
      "names, but only twenty were responded to; for one of the prisoners so\n",
      "summoned had died in gaol and been forgotten, and two had already been\n",
      "guillotined and forgotten. The list was read, in the vaulted chamber\n",
      "where Darnay had seen the associated prisoners on the night of his\n",
      "arrival. Every one of those had perished in the massacre; every human\n",
      "creature he had since cared for and parted with, had died on the\n",
      "scaffold.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were hurried words of farewell and kindness, but the parting was\n",
      "soon over. It was the incident of every day, and the society of La Force\n",
      "were engaged in the preparation of some games of forfeits and a little\n",
      "concert, for that evening. They crowded to the grates and shed tears\n",
      "there; but, twenty places in the projected entertainments had to be\n",
      "refilled, and the time was, at best, short to the lock-up hour, when the\n",
      "common rooms and corridors would be delivered over to the great dogs\n",
      "who kept watch there through the night. The prisoners were far from\n",
      "insensible or unfeeling; their ways arose out of the condition of the\n",
      "time. Similarly, though with a subtle difference, a species of fervour\n",
      "or intoxication, known, without doubt, to have led some persons to\n",
      "brave the guillotine unnecessarily, and to die by it, was not mere\n",
      "boastfulness, but a wild infection of the wildly shaken public mind. In\n",
      "seasons of pestilence, some of us will have a secret attraction to the\n",
      "disease--a terrible passing inclination to die of it. And all of us have\n",

      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The passage to the Conciergerie was short and dark; the night in its\n",
      "vermin-haunted cells was long and cold. Next day, fifteen prisoners were\n",
      "put to the bar before Charles Darnay’s name was called. All the fifteen\n",
      "were condemned, and the trials of the whole occupied an hour and a half.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "His judges sat upon the Bench in feathered hats; but the rough red cap\n",
      "and tricoloured cockade was the head-dress otherwise prevailing. Looking\n",
      "at the Jury and the turbulent audience, he might have thought that the\n",
      "usual order of things was reversed, and that the felons were trying the\n",
      "honest men. The lowest, cruelest, and worst populace of a city, never\n",
      "without its quantity of low, cruel, and bad, were the directing\n",
      "spirits of the scene: noisily commenting, applauding, disapproving,\n",
      "anticipating, and precipitating the result, without a check. Of the men,\n",
      "the greater part were armed in various ways; of the women, some wore\n",
      "knives, some daggers, some ate and drank as they looked on, many\n",
      "knitted. Among these last, was one, with a spare piece of knitting under\n",
      "her arm as she worked. She was in a front row, by the side of a man whom\n",
      "he had never seen since his arrival at the Barrier, but whom he directly\n",
      "remembered as Defarge. He noticed that she once or twice whispered in\n",
      "his ear, and that she seemed to be his wife; but, what he most noticed\n",
      "in the two figures was, that although they were posted as close to\n",
      "himself as they could be, they never looked towards him. They seemed to\n",
      "be waiting for something with a dogged determination, and they looked at\n",
      "the Jury, but at nothing else. Under the President sat Doctor Manette,\n",
      "in his usual quiet dress. As well as the prisoner could see, he and Mr.\n",
      "Lorry were the only men there, unconnected with the Tribunal, who\n",
      "wore their usual clothes, and had not assumed the coarse garb of the\n",
      "Carmagnole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charles Evrémonde, called Darnay, was accused by the public prosecutor\n",
      "as an emigrant, whose life was forfeit to the Republic, under the decree\n",
      "which banished all emigrants on pain of Death. It was nothing that the\n",
      "decree bore date since his return to France. There he was, and there was\n",
      "the decree; he had been taken in France, and his head was demanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Take off his head!” cried the audience. “An enemy to the Republic!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The President rang his bell to silence those cries, and asked the\n",

      "England?\n",
      "\n",
      "Undoubtedly it was.\n",

      "Not an emigrant, he hoped, within the sense and spirit of the law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why not? the President desired to know.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because he had voluntarily relinquished a title that was distasteful\n",
      "to him, and a station that was distasteful to him, and had left\n",
      "his country--he submitted before the word emigrant in the present\n",
      "acceptation by the Tribunal was in use--to live by his own industry in\n",
      "England, rather than on the industry of the overladen people of France.\n",
      "\n",
      "What proof had he of this?\n",
      "\n",
      "He handed in the names of two witnesses; Theophile Gabelle, and\n",
      "Alexandre Manette.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he had married in England? the President reminded him.\n",
      "\n",
      "True, but not an English woman.\n",

      "\n",
      "This answer had a happy effect upon the audience. Cries in exaltation\n",
      "of the well-known good physician rent the hall. So capriciously were\n",
      "the people moved, that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious\n",
      "countenances which had been glaring at the prisoner a moment before, as\n",
      "if with impatience to pluck him out into the streets and kill him.\n",
      "\n",

      "counsel directed every step that lay before him, and had prepared every\n",
      "inch of his road.\n",

      "The President asked, why had he returned to France when he did, and not\n",
      "sooner?\n",
      "\n",
      "He had not returned sooner, he replied, simply because he had no means\n",
      "of living in France, save those he had resigned; whereas, in England,\n",
      "he lived by giving instruction in the French language and literature.\n",
      "He had returned when he did, on the pressing and written entreaty of\n",
      "a French citizen, who represented that his life was endangered by his\n",
      "absence. He had come back, to save a citizen’s life, and to bear his\n",
      "testimony, at whatever personal hazard, to the truth. Was that criminal\n",
      "in the eyes of the Republic?\n",
      "\n",
      "The populace cried enthusiastically, “No!” and the President rang his\n",

      "\n",

      "that the citizen was his first witness. He also referred with confidence\n",
      "to the citizen’s letter, which had been taken from him at the Barrier,\n",
      "but which he did not doubt would be found among the papers then before\n",
      "the President.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Doctor had taken care that it should be there--had assured him that\n",
      "it would be there--and at this stage of the proceedings it was produced\n",
      "and read. Citizen Gabelle was called to confirm it, and did so. Citizen\n",
      "Gabelle hinted, with infinite delicacy and politeness, that in the\n",
      "pressure of business imposed on the Tribunal by the multitude of\n",
      "enemies of the Republic with which it had to deal, he had been slightly\n",
      "overlooked in his prison of the Abbaye--in fact, had rather passed out\n",
      "of the Tribunal’s patriotic remembrance--until three days ago; when he\n",
      "had been summoned before it, and had been set at liberty on the Jury’s\n",
      "declaring themselves satisfied that the accusation against him was\n",
      "answered, as to himself, by the surrender of the citizen Evrémonde,\n",
      "called Darnay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctor Manette was next questioned. His high personal popularity,\n",
      "and the clearness of his answers, made a great impression; but, as he\n",
      "proceeded, as he showed that the Accused was his first friend on his\n",
      "release from his long imprisonment; that, the accused had remained in\n",
      "England, always faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself in\n",
      "their exile; that, so far from being in favour with the Aristocrat\n",
      "government there, he had actually been tried for his life by it, as\n",
      "the foe of England and friend of the United States--as he brought these\n",
      "circumstances into view, with the greatest discretion and with the\n",
      "straightforward force of truth and earnestness, the Jury and the\n",
      "populace became one. At last, when he appealed by name to Monsieur\n",
      "Lorry, an English gentleman then and there present, who, like himself,\n",
      "had been a witness on that English trial and could corroborate his\n",
      "account of it, the Jury declared that they had heard enough, and that\n",
      "they were ready with their votes if the President were content to\n",
      "receive them.\n",
      "\n",
      "At every vote (the Jurymen voted aloud and individually), the populace\n",
      "set up a shout of applause. All the voices were in the prisoner’s\n",
      "favour, and the President declared him free.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, began one of those extraordinary scenes with which the populace\n",
      "sometimes gratified their fickleness, or their better impulses towards\n",
      "generosity and mercy, or which they regarded as some set-off against\n",
      "their swollen account of cruel rage. No man can decide now to which of\n",
      "these motives such extraordinary scenes were referable; it is probable,\n",
      "to a blending of all the three, with the second predominating. No sooner\n",
      "was the acquittal pronounced, than tears were shed as freely as blood\n",
      "at another time, and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the\n",
      "prisoner by as many of both sexes as could rush at him, that after\n",
      "his long and unwholesome confinement he was in danger of fainting from\n",
      "exhaustion; none the less because he knew very well, that the very same\n",
      "people, carried by another current, would have rushed at him with\n",
      "the very same intensity, to rend him to pieces and strew him over the\n",
      "streets.\n",
      "\n",
      "His removal, to make way for other accused persons who were to be tried,\n",
      "rescued him from these caresses for the moment. Five were to be tried\n",
      "together, next, as enemies of the Republic, forasmuch as they had not\n",
      "assisted it by word or deed. So quick was the Tribunal to compensate\n",
      "itself and the nation for a chance lost, that these five came down to\n",
      "him before he left the place, condemned to die within twenty-four\n",
      "hours. The first of them told him so, with the customary prison sign\n",
      "of Death--a raised finger--and they all added in words, “Long live the\n",

      "crowd about it, in which there seemed to be every face he had seen in\n",
      "Court--except two, for which he looked in vain. On his coming out, the\n",
      "concourse made at him anew, weeping, embracing, and shouting, all by\n",
      "turns and all together, until the very tide of the river on the bank of\n",
      "which the mad scene was acted, seemed to run mad, like the people on the\n",
      "shore.\n",

      "taken either out of the Court itself, or one of its rooms or passages.\n",
      "Over the chair they had thrown a red flag, and to the back of it they\n",
      "had bound a pike with a red cap on its top. In this car of triumph, not\n",
      "even the Doctor’s entreaties could prevent his being carried to his home\n",
      "on men’s shoulders, with a confused sea of red caps heaving about him,\n",
      "and casting up to sight from the stormy deep such wrecks of faces, that\n",
      "he more than once misdoubted his mind being in confusion, and that he\n",
      "was in the tumbril on his way to the Guillotine.\n",
      "\n",
      "In wild dreamlike procession, embracing whom they met and pointing\n",
      "him out, they carried him on. Reddening the snowy streets with the\n",
      "prevailing Republican colour, in winding and tramping through them, as\n",
      "they had reddened them below the snow with a deeper dye, they carried\n",
      "him thus into the courtyard of the building where he lived. Her father\n",
      "had gone on before, to prepare her, and when her husband stood upon his\n",
      "feet, she dropped insensible in his arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he held her to his heart and turned her beautiful head between his\n",
      "face and the brawling crowd, so that his tears and her lips might come\n",
      "together unseen, a few of the people fell to dancing. Instantly, all the\n",
      "rest fell to dancing, and the courtyard overflowed with the Carmagnole.\n",
      "Then, they elevated into the vacant chair a young woman from the\n",
      "crowd to be carried as the Goddess of Liberty, and then swelling and\n",
      "overflowing out into the adjacent streets, and along the river’s bank,\n",
      "and over the bridge, the Carmagnole absorbed them every one and whirled\n",
      "them away.\n",
      "\n",
      "After grasping the Doctor’s hand, as he stood victorious and proud\n",
      "before him; after grasping the hand of Mr. Lorry, who came panting in\n",
      "breathless from his struggle against the waterspout of the Carmagnole;\n",
      "after kissing little Lucie, who was lifted up to clasp her arms round\n",

      "Their housekeeping was of a very frugal kind: not only because that was\n",
      "the safest way of life, involving the least offence to the people, but\n",
      "because they were not rich, and Charles, throughout his imprisonment,\n",
      "had had to pay heavily for his bad food, and for his guard, and towards\n",
      "the living of the poorer prisoners. Partly on this account, and\n",
      "partly to avoid a domestic spy, they kept no servant; the citizen and\n",
      "citizeness who acted as porters at the courtyard gate, rendered them\n",
      "occasional service; and Jerry (almost wholly transferred to them by\n",

      "house, the name of every inmate must be legibly inscribed in letters\n",
      "of a certain size, at a certain convenient height from the ground. Mr.\n",
      "Jerry Cruncher’s name, therefore, duly embellished the doorpost down\n",

      "employed to add to the list the name of Charles Evrémonde, called\n",
      "Darnay.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time, all the usual\n",
      "harmless ways of life were changed. In the Doctor’s little household, as\n",
      "in very many others, the articles of daily consumption that were wanted\n",
      "were purchased every evening, in small quantities and at various small\n",
      "shops. To avoid attracting notice, and to give as little occasion as\n",
      "possible for talk and envy, was the general desire.\n",

      "For some months past, Miss Pross and Mr. Cruncher had discharged the\n",
      "office of purveyors; the former carrying the money; the latter, the\n",
      "basket. Every afternoon at about the time when the public lamps were\n",
      "lighted, they fared forth on this duty, and made and brought home\n",
      "such purchases as were needful. Although Miss Pross, through her long\n",
      "association with a French family, might have known as much of their\n",
      "language as of her own, if she had had a mind, she had no mind in that\n",
      "direction; consequently she knew no more of that “nonsense” (as she was\n",
      "pleased to call it) than Mr. Cruncher did. So her manner of marketing\n",
      "was to plump a noun-substantive at the head of a shopkeeper without any\n",
      "introduction in the nature of an article, and, if it happened not to be\n",
      "the name of the thing she wanted, to look round for that thing, lay hold\n",
      "of it, and hold on by it until the bargain was concluded. She always\n",
      "made a bargain for it, by holding up, as a statement of its just price,\n",
      "one finger less than the merchant held up, whatever his number might be.\n",

      "\n",
      "“There’s all manner of things wanted,” said Miss Pross, “and we shall\n",

      "\n",
      "“It will be much the same to your knowledge, miss, I should think,”\n",

      "\n",

      "“Hush, dear! Pray, pray, be cautious!” cried Lucie.\n",
      "\n",

      "among ourselves, that I do hope there will be no oniony and tobaccoey\n",
      "smotherings in the form of embracings all round, going on in the\n",
      "streets. Now, Ladybird, never you stir from that fire till I come back!\n",

      "\n",
      "“Well, my sweet,” said Miss Pross, nodding her head emphatically, “the\n",
      "short and the long of it is, that I am a subject of His Most Gracious\n",
      "Majesty King George the Third;” Miss Pross curtseyed at the name; “and\n",

      "way to affect to make light of anything that was a great anxiety\n",
      "with them all, and to come at it in this chance manner--“is there any\n",

      "“I fear not yet. It would be dangerous for Charles yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Heigh-ho-hum!” said Miss Pross, cheerfully repressing a sigh as she\n",
      "glanced at her darling’s golden hair in the light of the fire, “then we\n",
      "must have patience and wait: that’s all. We must hold up our heads and\n",

      "They went out, leaving Lucie, and her husband, her father, and the\n",
      "child, by a bright fire. Mr. Lorry was expected back presently from the\n",
      "Banking House. Miss Pross had lighted the lamp, but had put it aside in\n",
      "a corner, that they might enjoy the fire-light undisturbed. Little Lucie\n",
      "sat by her grandfather with her hands clasped through his arm: and he,\n",
      "in a tone not rising much above a whisper, began to tell her a story of\n",
      "a great and powerful Fairy who had opened a prison-wall and let out\n",
      "a captive who had once done the Fairy a service. All was subdued and\n",
      "quiet, and Lucie was more at ease than she had been.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is that?” she cried, all at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear!” said her father, stopping in his story, and laying his hand\n",
      "on hers, “command yourself. What a disordered state you are in! The\n",
      "least thing--nothing--startles you! _You_, your father’s daughter!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought, my father,” said Lucie, excusing herself, with a pale face\n",

      "“My love, the staircase is as still as Death.”\n",

      "to the door.”\n",

      "He took the lamp in his hand, crossed the two intervening outer rooms,\n",

      "Happily unconscious of the new calamity at home, Miss Pross threaded her\n",
      "way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge of the\n",
      "Pont-Neuf, reckoning in her mind the number of indispensable purchases\n",
      "she had to make. Mr. Cruncher, with the basket, walked at her side. They\n",
      "both looked to the right and to the left into most of the shops they\n",
      "passed, had a wary eye for all gregarious assemblages of people, and\n",
      "turned out of their road to avoid any very excited group of talkers. It\n",
      "was a raw evening, and the misty river, blurred to the eye with blazing\n",
      "lights and to the ear with harsh noises, showed where the barges were\n",
      "stationed in which the smiths worked, making guns for the Army of the\n",
      "Republic. Woe to the man who played tricks with _that_ Army, or got\n",
      "undeserved promotion in it! Better for him that his beard had never\n",
      "grown, for the National Razor shaved him close.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having purchased a few small articles of grocery, and a measure of oil\n",
      "for the lamp, Miss Pross bethought herself of the wine they wanted.\n",
      "After peeping into several wine-shops, she stopped at the sign of the\n",
      "Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, not far from the National Palace,\n",
      "once (and twice) the Tuileries, where the aspect of things rather\n",
      "took her fancy. It had a quieter look than any other place of the same\n",
      "description they had passed, and, though red with patriotic caps, was\n",
      "not so red as the rest. Sounding Mr. Cruncher, and finding him of her\n",
      "opinion, Miss Pross resorted to the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity,\n",
      "attended by her cavalier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Slightly observant of the smoky lights; of the people, pipe in mouth,\n",
      "playing with limp cards and yellow dominoes; of the one bare-breasted,\n",
      "bare-armed, soot-begrimed workman reading a journal aloud, and of\n",
      "the others listening to him; of the weapons worn, or laid aside to be\n",
      "resumed; of the two or three customers fallen forward asleep, who in the\n",
      "popular high-shouldered shaggy black spencer looked, in that attitude,\n",
      "like slumbering bears or dogs; the two outlandish customers approached\n",
      "the counter, and showed what they wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "As their wine was measuring out, a man parted from another man in a\n",
      "corner, and rose to depart. In going, he had to face Miss Pross. No\n",
      "sooner did he face her, than Miss Pross uttered a scream, and clapped\n",
      "her hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a moment, the whole company were on their feet. That somebody was\n",
      "assassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was the\n",
      "likeliest occurrence. Everybody looked to see somebody fall, but only\n",
      "saw a man and a woman standing staring at each other; the man with all\n",
      "the outward aspect of a Frenchman and a thorough Republican; the woman,\n",
      "evidently English.\n",
      "\n",
      "What was said in this disappointing anti-climax, by the disciples of the\n",
      "Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, except that it was something very\n",
      "voluble and loud, would have been as so much Hebrew or Chaldean to Miss\n",
      "Pross and her protector, though they had been all ears. But, they had no\n",
      "ears for anything in their surprise. For, it must be recorded, that\n",
      "not only was Miss Pross lost in amazement and agitation, but,\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher--though it seemed on his own separate and individual\n",
      "account--was in a state of the greatest wonder.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is the matter?” said the man who had caused Miss Pross to scream;\n",

      "English.\n",

      "\n",

      "man, in a furtive, frightened way.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Brother, brother!” cried Miss Pross, bursting into tears. “Have I ever\n",
      "been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then hold your meddlesome tongue,” said Solomon, “and come out, if you\n",
      "want to speak to me. Pay for your wine, and come out. Who’s this man?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Pross, shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no means\n",
      "affectionate brother, said through her tears, “Mr. Cruncher.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let him come out too,” said Solomon. “Does he think me a ghost?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Apparently, Mr. Cruncher did, to judge from his looks. He said not a\n",
      "word, however, and Miss Pross, exploring the depths of her reticule\n",
      "through her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine. As she did\n",
      "so, Solomon turned to the followers of the Good Republican Brutus\n",
      "of Antiquity, and offered a few words of explanation in the French\n",
      "language, which caused them all to relapse into their former places and\n",
      "pursuits.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now,” said Solomon, stopping at the dark street corner, “what do you\n",
      "want?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my love away\n",

      "affection.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There. Confound it! There,” said Solomon, making a dab at Miss Pross’s\n",
      "lips with his own. “Now are you content?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Pross only shook her head and wept in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you expect me to be surprised,” said her brother Solomon, “I am not\n",
      "surprised; I knew you were here; I know of most people who are here. If\n",
      "you really don’t want to endanger my existence--which I half believe you\n",
      "do--go your ways as soon as possible, and let me go mine. I am busy. I\n",
      "am an official.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My English brother Solomon,” mourned Miss Pross, casting up her\n",
      "tear-fraught eyes, “that had the makings in him of one of the best and\n",
      "greatest of men in his native country, an official among foreigners, and\n",
      "such foreigners! I would almost sooner have seen the dear boy lying in\n",
      "his--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I said so!” cried her brother, interrupting. “I knew it. You want to be\n",

      "as I am getting on!”\n",
      "\n",

      "rather would I never see you again, dear Solomon, though I have ever\n",
      "loved you truly, and ever shall. Say but one affectionate word to me,\n",
      "and tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us, and I will\n",
      "detain you no longer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Good Miss Pross! As if the estrangement between them had come of any\n",
      "culpability of hers. As if Mr. Lorry had not known it for a fact, years\n",
      "ago, in the quiet corner in Soho, that this precious brother had spent\n",
      "her money and left her!\n",
      "\n",
      "He was saying the affectionate word, however, with a far more grudging\n",
      "condescension and patronage than he could have shown if their relative\n",
      "merits and positions had been reversed (which is invariably the case,\n",
      "all the world over), when Mr. Cruncher, touching him on the shoulder,\n",
      "hoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with the following singular\n",
      "question:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I say! Might I ask the favour? As to whether your name is John Solomon,\n",
      "or Solomon John?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The official turned towards him with sudden distrust. He had not\n",
      "previously uttered a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come!” said Mr. Cruncher. “Speak out, you know.” (Which, by the way,\n",
      "was more than he could do himself.) “John Solomon, or Solomon John? She\n",
      "calls you Solomon, and she must know, being your sister. And _I_ know\n",
      "you’re John, you know. Which of the two goes first? And regarding that\n",
      "name of Pross, likewise. That warn’t your name over the water.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you mean?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I don’t know all I mean, for I can’t call to mind what your name\n",

      "\n",
      "“No?”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Yes. T’other one’s was one syllable. I know you. You was a spy--witness\n",

      "better employed brother than Mr. Barsad. I wish for your sake Mr. Barsad\n",
      "was not a Sheep of the Prisons.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy, under the gaolers. The spy,\n",
      "who was pale, turned paler, and asked him how he dared--\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll tell you,” said Sydney. “I lighted on you, Mr. Barsad, coming out\n",
      "of the prison of the Conciergerie while I was contemplating the walls,\n",
      "an hour or more ago. You have a face to be remembered, and I remember\n",
      "faces well. Made curious by seeing you in that connection, and having\n",
      "a reason, to which you are no stranger, for associating you with\n",
      "the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate, I walked in your\n",
      "direction. I walked into the wine-shop here, close after you, and\n",
      "sat near you. I had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved\n",
      "conversation, and the rumour openly going about among your admirers, the\n",
      "nature of your calling. And gradually, what I had done at random, seemed\n",
      "to shape itself into a purpose, Mr. Barsad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What purpose?” the spy asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It would be troublesome, and might be dangerous, to explain in the\n",
      "street. Could you favour me, in confidence, with some minutes of your\n",
      "company--at the office of Tellson’s Bank, for instance?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Under a threat?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! Did I say that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then, why should I go there?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Really, Mr. Barsad, I can’t say, if you can’t.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you mean that you won’t say, sir?” the spy irresolutely asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You apprehend me very clearly, Mr. Barsad. I won’t.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Carton’s negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid of his\n",
      "quickness and skill, in such a business as he had in his secret mind,\n",
      "and with such a man as he had to do with. His practised eye saw it, and\n",
      "made the most of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, I told you so,” said the spy, casting a reproachful look at his\n",
      "sister; “if any trouble comes of this, it’s your doing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, come, Mr. Barsad!” exclaimed Sydney. “Don’t be ungrateful.\n",
      "But for my great respect for your sister, I might not have led up so\n",
      "pleasantly to a little proposal that I wish to make for our mutual\n",
      "satisfaction. Do you go with me to the Bank?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll hear what you have got to say. Yes, I’ll go with you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of her\n",
      "own street. Let me take your arm, Miss Pross. This is not a good city,\n",
      "at this time, for you to be out in, unprotected; and as your escort\n",
      "knows Mr. Barsad, I will invite him to Mr. Lorry’s with us. Are we\n",
      "ready? Come then!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Pross recalled soon afterwards, and to the end of her life\n",
      "remembered, that as she pressed her hands on Sydney’s arm and looked up\n",
      "in his face, imploring him to do no hurt to Solomon, there was a braced\n",
      "purpose in the arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes, which not only\n",
      "contradicted his light manner, but changed and raised the man. She was\n",
      "too much occupied then with fears for the brother who so little deserved\n",
      "her affection, and with Sydney’s friendly reassurances, adequately to\n",
      "heed what she observed.\n",
      "\n",
      "They left her at the corner of the street, and Carton led the way to Mr.\n",
      "Lorry’s, which was within a few minutes’ walk. John Barsad, or Solomon\n",
      "Pross, walked at his side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry had just finished his dinner, and was sitting before a cheery\n",
      "little log or two of fire--perhaps looking into their blaze for the\n",
      "picture of that younger elderly gentleman from Tellson’s, who had looked\n",
      "into the red coals at the Royal George at Dover, now a good many years\n",
      "ago. He turned his head as they entered, and showed the surprise with\n",
      "which he saw a stranger.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Pross’s brother, sir,” said Sydney. “Mr. Barsad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Barsad?” repeated the old gentleman, “Barsad? I have an association\n",
      "with the name--and with the face.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I told you you had a remarkable face, Mr. Barsad,” observed Carton,\n",
      "coolly. “Pray sit down.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As he took a chair himself, he supplied the link that Mr. Lorry wanted,\n",
      "by saying to him with a frown, “Witness at that trial.” Mr. Lorry\n",
      "immediately remembered, and regarded his new visitor with an undisguised\n",
      "look of abhorrence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Barsad has been recognised by Miss Pross as the affectionate\n",
      "brother you have heard of,” said Sydney, “and has acknowledged the\n",
      "relationship. I pass to worse news. Darnay has been arrested again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Struck with consternation, the old gentleman exclaimed, “What do you\n",
      "tell me! I left him safe and free within these two hours, and am about\n",
      "to return to him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Arrested for all that. When was it done, Mr. Barsad?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just now, if at all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Barsad is the best authority possible, sir,” said Sydney, “and I\n",
      "have it from Mr. Barsad’s communication to a friend and brother Sheep\n",
      "over a bottle of wine, that the arrest has taken place. He left the\n",
      "messengers at the gate, and saw them admitted by the porter. There is no\n",
      "earthly doubt that he is retaken.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry’s business eye read in the speaker’s face that it was loss\n",
      "of time to dwell upon the point. Confused, but sensible that something\n",
      "might depend on his presence of mind, he commanded himself, and was\n",
      "silently attentive.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, I trust,” said Sydney to him, “that the name and influence of\n",
      "Doctor Manette may stand him in as good stead to-morrow--you said he\n",
      "would be before the Tribunal again to-morrow, Mr. Barsad?--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; I believe so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“--In as good stead to-morrow as to-day. But it may not be so. I own\n",
      "to you, I am shaken, Mr. Lorry, by Doctor Manette’s not having had the\n",
      "power to prevent this arrest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He may not have known of it beforehand,” said Mr. Lorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But that very circumstance would be alarming, when we remember how\n",
      "identified he is with his son-in-law.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s true,” Mr. Lorry acknowledged, with his troubled hand at his\n",
      "chin, and his troubled eyes on Carton.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In short,” said Sydney, “this is a desperate time, when desperate games\n",
      "are played for desperate stakes. Let the Doctor play the winning game; I\n",
      "will play the losing one. No man’s life here is worth purchase. Any one\n",
      "carried home by the people to-day, may be condemned tomorrow. Now, the\n",
      "stake I have resolved to play for, in case of the worst, is a friend\n",
      "in the Conciergerie. And the friend I purpose to myself to win, is Mr.\n",
      "Barsad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You need have good cards, sir,” said the spy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll run them over. I’ll see what I hold,--Mr. Lorry, you know what a\n",
      "brute I am; I wish you’d give me a little brandy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was put before him, and he drank off a glassful--drank off another\n",
      "glassful--pushed the bottle thoughtfully away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Barsad,” he went on, in the tone of one who really was looking\n",
      "over a hand at cards: “Sheep of the prisons, emissary of Republican\n",
      "committees, now turnkey, now prisoner, always spy and secret informer,\n",
      "so much the more valuable here for being English that an Englishman\n",
      "is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a\n",
      "Frenchman, represents himself to his employers under a false name.\n",
      "That’s a very good card. Mr. Barsad, now in the employ of the republican\n",
      "French government, was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic\n",
      "English government, the enemy of France and freedom. That’s an excellent\n",
      "card. Inference clear as day in this region of suspicion, that Mr.\n",
      "Barsad, still in the pay of the aristocratic English government, is the\n",
      "spy of Pitt, the treacherous foe of the Republic crouching in its bosom,\n",
      "the English traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so\n",
      "difficult to find. That’s a card not to be beaten. Have you followed my\n",
      "hand, Mr. Barsad?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not to understand your play,” returned the spy, somewhat uneasily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I play my Ace, Denunciation of Mr. Barsad to the nearest Section\n",
      "Committee. Look over your hand, Mr. Barsad, and see what you have. Don’t\n",
      "hurry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He drew the bottle near, poured out another glassful of brandy, and\n",
      "drank it off. He saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking himself\n",
      "into a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him. Seeing it, he\n",
      "poured out and drank another glassful.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look over your hand carefully, Mr. Barsad. Take time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a poorer hand than he suspected. Mr. Barsad saw losing cards\n",
      "in it that Sydney Carton knew nothing of. Thrown out of his honourable\n",
      "employment in England, through too much unsuccessful hard swearing\n",
      "there--not because he was not wanted there; our English reasons for\n",
      "vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern\n",
      "date--he knew that he had crossed the Channel, and accepted service in\n",
      "France: first, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his own countrymen\n",
      "there: gradually, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the natives. He\n",
      "knew that under the overthrown government he had been a spy upon Saint\n",
      "Antoine and Defarge’s wine-shop; had received from the watchful police\n",
      "such heads of information concerning Doctor Manette’s imprisonment,\n",
      "release, and history, as should serve him for an introduction to\n",
      "familiar conversation with the Defarges; and tried them on Madame\n",
      "Defarge, and had broken down with them signally. He always remembered\n",
      "with fear and trembling, that that terrible woman had knitted when he\n",
      "talked with her, and had looked ominously at him as her fingers moved.\n",
      "He had since seen her, in the Section of Saint Antoine, over and over\n",
      "again produce her knitted registers, and denounce people whose lives the\n",
      "guillotine then surely swallowed up. He knew, as every one employed as\n",
      "he was did, that he was never safe; that flight was impossible; that\n",
      "he was tied fast under the shadow of the axe; and that in spite of\n",
      "his utmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the reigning\n",
      "terror, a word might bring it down upon him. Once denounced, and on such\n",
      "grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind, he foresaw\n",
      "that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he had seen many\n",
      "proofs, would produce against him that fatal register, and would quash\n",
      "his last chance of life. Besides that all secret men are men soon\n",
      "terrified, here were surely cards enough of one black suit, to justify\n",
      "the holder in growing rather livid as he turned them over.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You scarcely seem to like your hand,” said Sydney, with the greatest\n",
      "composure. “Do you play?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think, sir,” said the spy, in the meanest manner, as he turned to Mr.\n",
      "Lorry, “I may appeal to a gentleman of your years and benevolence, to\n",
      "put it to this other gentleman, so much your junior, whether he can\n",
      "under any circumstances reconcile it to his station to play that Ace\n",
      "of which he has spoken. I admit that _I_ am a spy, and that it is\n",
      "considered a discreditable station--though it must be filled by\n",
      "somebody; but this gentleman is no spy, and why should he so demean\n",
      "himself as to make himself one?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I play my Ace, Mr. Barsad,” said Carton, taking the answer on himself,\n",
      "and looking at his watch, “without any scruple, in a very few minutes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should have hoped, gentlemen both,” said the spy, always striving to\n",
      "hook Mr. Lorry into the discussion, “that your respect for my sister--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I could not better testify my respect for your sister than by finally\n",
      "relieving her of her brother,” said Sydney Carton.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You think not, sir?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have thoroughly made up my mind about it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The smooth manner of the spy, curiously in dissonance with his\n",
      "ostentatiously rough dress, and probably with his usual demeanour,\n",
      "received such a check from the inscrutability of Carton,--who was a\n",
      "mystery to wiser and honester men than he,--that it faltered here and\n",
      "failed him. While he was at a loss, Carton said, resuming his former air\n",
      "of contemplating cards:\n",
      "\n",
      "“And indeed, now I think again, I have a strong impression that I\n",
      "have another good card here, not yet enumerated. That friend and\n",
      "fellow-Sheep, who spoke of himself as pasturing in the country prisons;\n",
      "who was he?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“French. You don’t know him,” said the spy, quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“French, eh?” repeated Carton, musing, and not appearing to notice him\n",
      "at all, though he echoed his word. “Well; he may be.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is, I assure you,” said the spy; “though it’s not important.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Though it’s not important,” repeated Carton, in the same mechanical\n",
      "way--“though it’s not important--No, it’s not important. No. Yet I know\n",
      "the face.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think not. I am sure not. It can’t be,” said the spy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It-can’t-be,” muttered Sydney Carton, retrospectively, and idling his\n",
      "glass (which fortunately was a small one) again. “Can’t-be. Spoke good\n",
      "French. Yet like a foreigner, I thought?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Provincial,” said the spy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. Foreign!” cried Carton, striking his open hand on the table, as a\n",
      "light broke clearly on his mind. “Cly! Disguised, but the same man. We\n",
      "had that man before us at the Old Bailey.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, there you are hasty, sir,” said Barsad, with a smile that gave his\n",
      "aquiline nose an extra inclination to one side; “there you really give\n",
      "me an advantage over you. Cly (who I will unreservedly admit, at this\n",
      "distance of time, was a partner of mine) has been dead several years. I\n",
      "attended him in his last illness. He was buried in London, at the church\n",
      "of Saint Pancras-in-the-Fields. His unpopularity with the blackguard\n",
      "multitude at the moment prevented my following his remains, but I helped\n",
      "to lay him in his coffin.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, Mr. Lorry became aware, from where he sat, of a most remarkable\n",
      "goblin shadow on the wall. Tracing it to its source, he discovered it\n",
      "to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all the\n",
      "risen and stiff hair on Mr. Cruncher’s head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let us be reasonable,” said the spy, “and let us be fair. To show you\n",
      "how mistaken you are, and what an unfounded assumption yours is, I will\n",
      "lay before you a certificate of Cly’s burial, which I happened to have\n",
      "carried in my pocket-book,” with a hurried hand he produced and opened\n",
      "it, “ever since. There it is. Oh, look at it, look at it! You may take\n",
      "it in your hand; it’s no forgery.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, Mr. Lorry perceived the reflection on the wall to elongate, and\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher rose and stepped forward. His hair could not have been more\n",
      "violently on end, if it had been that moment dressed by the Cow with the\n",
      "crumpled horn in the house that Jack built.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unseen by the spy, Mr. Cruncher stood at his side, and touched him on\n",
      "the shoulder like a ghostly bailiff.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That there Roger Cly, master,” said Mr. Cruncher, with a taciturn and\n",
      "iron-bound visage. “So _you_ put him in his coffin?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I did.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who took him out of it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Barsad leaned back in his chair, and stammered, “What do you mean?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I mean,” said Mr. Cruncher, “that he warn’t never in it. No! Not he!\n",
      "I’ll have my head took off, if he was ever in it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The spy looked round at the two gentlemen; they both looked in\n",
      "unspeakable astonishment at Jerry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I tell you,” said Jerry, “that you buried paving-stones and earth in\n",
      "that there coffin. Don’t go and tell me that you buried Cly. It was a\n",
      "take in. Me and two more knows it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How do you know it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What’s that to you? Ecod!” growled Mr. Cruncher, “it’s you I have got a\n",
      "old grudge again, is it, with your shameful impositions upon tradesmen!\n",
      "I’d catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sydney Carton, who, with Mr. Lorry, had been lost in amazement at\n",
      "this turn of the business, here requested Mr. Cruncher to moderate and\n",
      "explain himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At another time, sir,” he returned, evasively, “the present time is\n",
      "ill-conwenient for explainin’. What I stand to, is, that he knows well\n",
      "wot that there Cly was never in that there coffin. Let him say he was,\n",
      "in so much as a word of one syllable, and I’ll either catch hold of his\n",
      "throat and choke him for half a guinea;” Mr. Cruncher dwelt upon this as\n",
      "quite a liberal offer; “or I’ll out and announce him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Humph! I see one thing,” said Carton. “I hold another card, Mr. Barsad.\n",
      "Impossible, here in raging Paris, with Suspicion filling the air, for\n",
      "you to outlive denunciation, when you are in communication with another\n",
      "aristocratic spy of the same antecedents as yourself, who, moreover, has\n",
      "the mystery about him of having feigned death and come to life again!\n",
      "A plot in the prisons, of the foreigner against the Republic. A strong\n",
      "card--a certain Guillotine card! Do you play?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No!” returned the spy. “I throw up. I confess that we were so unpopular\n",
      "with the outrageous mob, that I only got away from England at the risk\n",
      "of being ducked to death, and that Cly was so ferreted up and down, that\n",
      "he never would have got away at all but for that sham. Though how this\n",
      "man knows it was a sham, is a wonder of wonders to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never you trouble your head about this man,” retorted the contentious\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher; “you’ll have trouble enough with giving your attention to\n",
      "that gentleman. And look here! Once more!”--Mr. Cruncher could not\n",
      "be restrained from making rather an ostentatious parade of his\n",
      "liberality--“I’d catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a\n",
      "guinea.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Sheep of the prisons turned from him to Sydney Carton, and said,\n",
      "with more decision, “It has come to a point. I go on duty soon, and\n",
      "can’t overstay my time. You told me you had a proposal; what is it?\n",
      "Now, it is of no use asking too much of me. Ask me to do anything in my\n",
      "office, putting my head in great extra danger, and I had better trust my\n",
      "life to the chances of a refusal than the chances of consent. In short,\n",
      "I should make that choice. You talk of desperation. We are all desperate\n",
      "here. Remember! I may denounce you if I think proper, and I can swear my\n",
      "way through stone walls, and so can others. Now, what do you want with\n",

      "While Sydney Carton and the Sheep of the prisons were in the adjoining\n",
      "dark room, speaking so low that not a sound was heard, Mr. Lorry looked\n",
      "at Jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust. That honest tradesman’s\n",
      "manner of receiving the look, did not inspire confidence; he changed the\n",
      "leg on which he rested, as often as if he had fifty of those limbs,\n",
      "and were trying them all; he examined his finger-nails with a very\n",
      "questionable closeness of attention; and whenever Mr. Lorry’s eye caught\n",
      "his, he was taken with that peculiar kind of short cough requiring the\n",
      "hollow of a hand before it, which is seldom, if ever, known to be an\n",
      "infirmity attendant on perfect openness of character.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jerry,” said Mr. Lorry. “Come here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher came forward sideways, with one of his shoulders in advance\n",
      "of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What have you been, besides a messenger?”\n",
      "\n",
      "After some cogitation, accompanied with an intent look at his patron,\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher conceived the luminous idea of replying, “Agicultooral\n",
      "character.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My mind misgives me much,” said Mr. Lorry, angrily shaking a forefinger\n",
      "at him, “that you have used the respectable and great house of Tellson’s\n",
      "as a blind, and that you have had an unlawful occupation of an infamous\n",
      "description. If you have, don’t expect me to befriend you when you\n",
      "get back to England. If you have, don’t expect me to keep your secret.\n",
      "Tellson’s shall not be imposed upon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope, sir,” pleaded the abashed Mr. Cruncher, “that a gentleman like\n",
      "yourself wot I’ve had the honour of odd jobbing till I’m grey at it,\n",
      "would think twice about harming of me, even if it wos so--I don’t say it\n",
      "is, but even if it wos. And which it is to be took into account that if\n",
      "it wos, it wouldn’t, even then, be all o’ one side. There’d be two sides\n",
      "to it. There might be medical doctors at the present hour, a picking\n",
      "up their guineas where a honest tradesman don’t pick up his\n",
      "fardens--fardens! no, nor yet his half fardens--half fardens! no, nor\n",
      "yet his quarter--a banking away like smoke at Tellson’s, and a cocking\n",
      "their medical eyes at that tradesman on the sly, a going in and going\n",
      "out to their own carriages--ah! equally like smoke, if not more so.\n",
      "Well, that ’ud be imposing, too, on Tellson’s. For you cannot sarse the\n",
      "goose and not the gander. And here’s Mrs. Cruncher, or leastways wos\n",
      "in the Old England times, and would be to-morrow, if cause given,\n",
      "a floppin’ again the business to that degree as is ruinating--stark\n",
      "ruinating! Whereas them medical doctors’ wives don’t flop--catch ’em at\n",
      "it! Or, if they flop, their floppings goes in favour of more patients,\n",
      "and how can you rightly have one without t’other? Then, wot with\n",
      "undertakers, and wot with parish clerks, and wot with sextons, and wot\n",
      "with private watchmen (all awaricious and all in it), a man wouldn’t get\n",
      "much by it, even if it wos so. And wot little a man did get, would never\n",
      "prosper with him, Mr. Lorry. He’d never have no good of it; he’d want\n",
      "all along to be out of the line, if he, could see his way out, being\n",
      "once in--even if it wos so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ugh!” cried Mr. Lorry, rather relenting, nevertheless, “I am shocked at\n",
      "the sight of you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, what I would humbly offer to you, sir,” pursued Mr. Cruncher,\n",
      "“even if it wos so, which I don’t say it is--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t prevaricate,” said Mr. Lorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I will _not_, sir,” returned Mr. Crunches as if nothing were\n",
      "further from his thoughts or practice--“which I don’t say it is--wot I\n",
      "would humbly offer to you, sir, would be this. Upon that there stool, at\n",
      "that there Bar, sets that there boy of mine, brought up and growed up to\n",
      "be a man, wot will errand you, message you, general-light-job you, till\n",
      "your heels is where your head is, if such should be your wishes. If it\n",
      "wos so, which I still don’t say it is (for I will not prewaricate to\n",
      "you, sir), let that there boy keep his father’s place, and take care of\n",
      "his mother; don’t blow upon that boy’s father--do not do it, sir--and\n",
      "let that father go into the line of the reg’lar diggin’, and make amends\n",
      "for what he would have undug--if it wos so--by diggin’ of ’em in with\n",
      "a will, and with conwictions respectin’ the futur’ keepin’ of ’em safe.\n",
      "That, Mr. Lorry,” said Mr. Cruncher, wiping his forehead with his\n",
      "arm, as an announcement that he had arrived at the peroration of his\n",
      "discourse, “is wot I would respectfully offer to you, sir. A man don’t\n",
      "see all this here a goin’ on dreadful round him, in the way of Subjects\n",
      "without heads, dear me, plentiful enough fur to bring the price down\n",
      "to porterage and hardly that, without havin’ his serious thoughts of\n",
      "things. And these here would be mine, if it wos so, entreatin’ of you\n",
      "fur to bear in mind that wot I said just now, I up and said in the good\n",
      "cause when I might have kep’ it back.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That at least is true,” said Mr. Lorry. “Say no more now. It may be\n",
      "that I shall yet stand your friend, if you deserve it, and repent in\n",
      "action--not in words. I want no more words.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher knuckled his forehead, as Sydney Carton and the spy\n",
      "returned from the dark room. “Adieu, Mr. Barsad,” said the former; “our\n",
      "arrangement thus made, you have nothing to fear from me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat down in a chair on the hearth, over against Mr. Lorry. When they\n",
      "were alone, Mr. Lorry asked him what he had done?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not much. If it should go ill with the prisoner, I have ensured access\n",
      "to him, once.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry’s countenance fell.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is all I could do,” said Carton. “To propose too much, would be\n",
      "to put this man’s head under the axe, and, as he himself said, nothing\n",
      "worse could happen to him if he were denounced. It was obviously the\n",
      "weakness of the position. There is no help for it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But access to him,” said Mr. Lorry, “if it should go ill before the\n",
      "Tribunal, will not save him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never said it would.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry’s eyes gradually sought the fire; his sympathy with his\n",
      "darling, and the heavy disappointment of his second arrest, gradually\n",
      "weakened them; he was an old man now, overborne with anxiety of late,\n",
      "and his tears fell.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are a good man and a true friend,” said Carton, in an altered\n",
      "voice. “Forgive me if I notice that you are affected. I could not see my\n",
      "father weep, and sit by, careless. And I could not respect your\n",
      "sorrow more, if you were my father. You are free from that misfortune,\n",
      "however.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Though he said the last words, with a slip into his usual manner, there\n",
      "was a true feeling and respect both in his tone and in his touch,\n",
      "that Mr. Lorry, who had never seen the better side of him, was wholly\n",
      "unprepared for. He gave him his hand, and Carton gently pressed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To return to poor Darnay,” said Carton. “Don’t tell Her of this\n",
      "interview, or this arrangement. It would not enable Her to go to see\n",
      "him. She might think it was contrived, in case of the worse, to convey\n",
      "to him the means of anticipating the sentence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry had not thought of that, and he looked quickly at Carton to\n",
      "see if it were in his mind. It seemed to be; he returned the look, and\n",
      "evidently understood it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She might think a thousand things,” Carton said, “and any of them would\n",
      "only add to her trouble. Don’t speak of me to her. As I said to you when\n",
      "I first came, I had better not see her. I can put my hand out, to do any\n",
      "little helpful work for her that my hand can find to do, without that.\n",
      "You are going to her, I hope? She must be very desolate to-night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am going now, directly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am glad of that. She has such a strong attachment to you and reliance\n",
      "on you. How does she look?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Anxious and unhappy, but very beautiful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah!”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a long, grieving sound, like a sigh--almost like a sob. It\n",
      "attracted Mr. Lorry’s eyes to Carton’s face, which was turned to the\n",
      "fire. A light, or a shade (the old gentleman could not have said which),\n",
      "passed from it as swiftly as a change will sweep over a hill-side on a\n",
      "wild bright day, and he lifted his foot to put back one of the little\n",
      "flaming logs, which was tumbling forward. He wore the white riding-coat\n",
      "and top-boots, then in vogue, and the light of the fire touching their\n",
      "light surfaces made him look very pale, with his long brown hair,\n",
      "all untrimmed, hanging loose about him. His indifference to fire was\n",
      "sufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of remonstrance from Mr. Lorry;\n",
      "his boot was still upon the hot embers of the flaming log, when it had\n",
      "broken under the weight of his foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I forgot it,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry’s eyes were again attracted to his face. Taking note of the\n",
      "wasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features, and having\n",
      "the expression of prisoners’ faces fresh in his mind, he was strongly\n",
      "reminded of that expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And your duties here have drawn to an end, sir?” said Carton, turning\n",
      "to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. As I was telling you last night when Lucie came in so\n",
      "unexpectedly, I have at length done all that I can do here. I hoped to\n",
      "have left them in perfect safety, and then to have quitted Paris. I have\n",
      "my Leave to Pass. I was ready to go.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They were both silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yours is a long life to look back upon, sir?” said Carton, wistfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am in my seventy-eighth year.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have been useful all your life; steadily and constantly occupied;\n",
      "trusted, respected, and looked up to?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have been a man of business, ever since I have been a man. Indeed, I\n",
      "may say that I was a man of business when a boy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“See what a place you fill at seventy-eight. How many people will miss\n",
      "you when you leave it empty!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A solitary old bachelor,” answered Mr. Lorry, shaking his head. “There\n",
      "is nobody to weep for me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How can you say that? Wouldn’t She weep for you? Wouldn’t her child?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, yes, thank God. I didn’t quite mean what I said.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It _is_ a thing to thank God for; is it not?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Surely, surely.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you could say, with truth, to your own solitary heart, to-night,\n",
      "‘I have secured to myself the love and attachment, the gratitude or\n",
      "respect, of no human creature; I have won myself a tender place in no\n",
      "regard; I have done nothing good or serviceable to be remembered by!’\n",
      "your seventy-eight years would be seventy-eight heavy curses; would they\n",
      "not?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You say truly, Mr. Carton; I think they would be.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sydney turned his eyes again upon the fire, and, after a silence of a\n",
      "few moments, said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should like to ask you:--Does your childhood seem far off? Do the\n",
      "days when you sat at your mother’s knee, seem days of very long ago?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Responding to his softened manner, Mr. Lorry answered:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Twenty years back, yes; at this time of my life, no. For, as I draw\n",
      "closer and closer to the end, I travel in the circle, nearer and\n",
      "nearer to the beginning. It seems to be one of the kind smoothings and\n",
      "preparings of the way. My heart is touched now, by many remembrances\n",
      "that had long fallen asleep, of my pretty young mother (and I so old!),\n",
      "and by many associations of the days when what we call the World was not\n",
      "so real with me, and my faults were not confirmed in me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I understand the feeling!” exclaimed Carton, with a bright flush. “And\n",
      "you are the better for it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Carton terminated the conversation here, by rising to help him on with\n",
      "his outer coat; “But you,” said Mr. Lorry, reverting to the theme, “you\n",
      "are young.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said Carton. “I am not old, but my young way was never the way to\n",
      "age. Enough of me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And of me, I am sure,” said Mr. Lorry. “Are you going out?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll walk with you to her gate. You know my vagabond and restless\n",
      "habits. If I should prowl about the streets a long time, don’t be\n",
      "uneasy; I shall reappear in the morning. You go to the Court to-morrow?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, unhappily.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall be there, but only as one of the crowd. My Spy will find a\n",
      "place for me. Take my arm, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry did so, and they went down-stairs and out in the streets. A\n",
      "few minutes brought them to Mr. Lorry’s destination. Carton left him\n",
      "there; but lingered at a little distance, and turned back to the gate\n",
      "again when it was shut, and touched it. He had heard of her going to\n",
      "the prison every day. “She came out here,” he said, looking about him,\n",
      "“turned this way, must have trod on these stones often. Let me follow in\n",
      "her steps.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was ten o’clock at night when he stood before the prison of La Force,\n",
      "where she had stood hundreds of times. A little wood-sawyer, having\n",
      "closed his shop, was smoking his pipe at his shop-door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good night, citizen,” said Sydney Carton, pausing in going by; for, the\n",
      "man eyed him inquisitively.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good night, citizen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How goes the Republic?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You mean the Guillotine. Not ill. Sixty-three to-day. We shall mount\n",
      "to a hundred soon. Samson and his men complain sometimes, of being\n",
      "exhausted. Ha, ha, ha! He is so droll, that Samson. Such a Barber!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you often go to see him--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shave? Always. Every day. What a barber! You have seen him at work?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go and see him when he has a good batch. Figure this to yourself,\n",
      "citizen; he shaved the sixty-three to-day, in less than two pipes! Less\n",
      "than two pipes. Word of honour!”\n",
      "\n",
      "As the grinning little man held out the pipe he was smoking, to explain\n",
      "how he timed the executioner, Carton was so sensible of a rising desire\n",
      "to strike the life out of him, that he turned away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But you are not English,” said the wood-sawyer, “though you wear\n",
      "English dress?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said Carton, pausing again, and answering over his shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You speak like a Frenchman.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am an old student here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aha, a perfect Frenchman! Good night, Englishman.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good night, citizen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But go and see that droll dog,” the little man persisted, calling after\n",
      "him. “And take a pipe with you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sydney had not gone far out of sight, when he stopped in the middle of\n",
      "the street under a glimmering lamp, and wrote with his pencil on a scrap\n",
      "of paper. Then, traversing with the decided step of one who remembered\n",
      "the way well, several dark and dirty streets--much dirtier than usual,\n",
      "for the best public thoroughfares remained uncleansed in those times of\n",
      "terror--he stopped at a chemist’s shop, which the owner was closing with\n",
      "his own hands. A small, dim, crooked shop, kept in a tortuous, up-hill\n",
      "thoroughfare, by a small, dim, crooked man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Giving this citizen, too, good night, as he confronted him at his\n",
      "counter, he laid the scrap of paper before him. “Whew!” the chemist\n",
      "whistled softly, as he read it. “Hi! hi! hi!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sydney Carton took no heed, and the chemist said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“For you, citizen?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You will be careful to keep them separate, citizen? You know the\n",
      "consequences of mixing them?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perfectly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Certain small packets were made and given to him. He put them, one by\n",
      "one, in the breast of his inner coat, counted out the money for them,\n",
      "and deliberately left the shop. “There is nothing more to do,” said he,\n",
      "glancing upward at the moon, “until to-morrow. I can’t sleep.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not a reckless manner, the manner in which he said these words\n",
      "aloud under the fast-sailing clouds, nor was it more expressive of\n",
      "negligence than defiance. It was the settled manner of a tired man, who\n",
      "had wandered and struggled and got lost, but who at length struck into\n",
      "his road and saw its end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long ago, when he had been famous among his earliest competitors as a\n",
      "youth of great promise, he had followed his father to the grave. His\n",
      "mother had died, years before. These solemn words, which had been\n",
      "read at his father’s grave, arose in his mind as he went down the dark\n",
      "streets, among the heavy shadows, with the moon and the clouds sailing\n",
      "on high above him. “I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord:\n",
      "he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and\n",
      "whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In a city dominated by the axe, alone at night, with natural sorrow\n",
      "rising in him for the sixty-three who had been that day put to death,\n",
      "and for to-morrow’s victims then awaiting their doom in the prisons,\n",
      "and still of to-morrow’s and to-morrow’s, the chain of association that\n",
      "brought the words home, like a rusty old ship’s anchor from the deep,\n",
      "might have been easily found. He did not seek it, but repeated them and\n",

      "by the two Evrémonde brothers, as that Bastille paper describes, is my\n",
      "family. Defarge, that sister of the mortally wounded boy upon the ground\n",
      "was my sister, that husband was my sister’s husband, that unborn child\n",
      "was their child, that brother was my brother, that father was my father,\n",

      "a few words for the memory of the compassionate wife of the Marquis; but\n",

      "Customers entered, and the group was broken up. The English customer\n",
      "paid for what he had had, perplexedly counted his change, and asked, as\n",
      "a stranger, to be directed towards the National Palace. Madame Defarge\n",
      "took him to the door, and put her arm on his, in pointing out the road.\n",

      "himself in Mr. Lorry’s room again, where he found the old gentleman\n",
      "walking to and fro in restless anxiety. He said he had been with Lucie\n",
      "until just now, and had only left her for a few minutes, to come and\n",
      "keep his appointment. Her father had not been seen, since he quitted the\n",

      "In the meanwhile, Carton would wait alone by the fire for the Doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "He waited and waited, and the clock struck twelve; but Doctor Manette\n",
      "did not come back. Mr. Lorry returned, and found no tidings of him, and\n",
      "brought none. Where could he be?\n",
      "\n",
      "They were discussing this question, and were almost building up some\n",
      "weak structure of hope on his prolonged absence, when they heard him on\n",
      "the stairs. The instant he entered the room, it was plain that all was\n",
      "lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether he had really been to any one, or whether he had been all that\n",
      "time traversing the streets, was never known. As he stood staring at\n",
      "them, they asked him no question, for his face told them everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I cannot find it,” said he, “and I must have it. Where is it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "His head and throat were bare, and, as he spoke with a helpless look\n",
      "straying all around, he took his coat off, and let it drop on the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where is my bench? I have been looking everywhere for my bench, and I\n",
      "can’t find it. What have they done with my work? Time presses: I must\n",
      "finish those shoes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They looked at one another, and their hearts died within them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, come!” said he, in a whimpering miserable way; “let me get to\n",
      "work. Give me my work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Receiving no answer, he tore his hair, and beat his feet upon the\n",
      "ground, like a distracted child.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t torture a poor forlorn wretch,” he implored them, with a dreadful\n",

      "soothed him to sit down before the fire, with a promise that he should\n",
      "have his work presently. He sank into the chair, and brooded over the\n",
      "embers, and shed tears. As if all that had happened since the garret\n",
      "time were a momentary fancy, or a dream, Mr. Lorry saw him shrink into\n",
      "the exact figure that Defarge had had in keeping.\n",
      "\n",
      "Affected, and impressed with terror as they both were, by this spectacle\n",
      "of ruin, it was not a time to yield to such emotions. His lonely\n",
      "daughter, bereft of her final hope and reliance, appealed to them both\n",
      "too strongly. Again, as if by agreement, they looked at one another with\n",
      "one meaning in their faces. Carton was the first to speak:\n",
      "\n",
      "“The last chance is gone: it was not much. Yes; he had better be taken\n",
      "to her. But, before you go, will you, for a moment, steadily attend to\n",
      "me? Don’t ask me why I make the stipulations I am going to make, and\n",
      "exact the promise I am going to exact; I have a reason--a good one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not doubt it,” answered Mr. Lorry. “Say on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The figure in the chair between them, was all the time monotonously\n",
      "rocking itself to and fro, and moaning. They spoke in such a tone as\n",

      "night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Carton stooped to pick up the coat, which lay almost entangling his\n",
      "feet. As he did so, a small case in which the Doctor was accustomed to\n",
      "carry the lists of his day’s duties, fell lightly on the floor. Carton\n",
      "took it up, and there was a folded paper in it. “We should look\n",
      "at this!” he said. Mr. Lorry nodded his consent. He opened it, and\n",
      "exclaimed, “Thank _God!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is it?” asked Mr. Lorry, eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A moment! Let me speak of it in its place. First,” he put his hand in\n",
      "his coat, and took another paper from it, “that is the certificate which\n",
      "enables me to pass out of this city. Look at it. You see--Sydney Carton,\n",
      "an Englishman?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry held it open in his hand, gazing in his earnest face.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Why not?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know; I prefer not to do so. Now, take this paper that Doctor\n",
      "Manette has carried about him. It is a similar certificate, enabling him\n",
      "and his daughter and her child, at any time, to pass the barrier and the\n",
      "frontier! You see?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps he obtained it as his last and utmost precaution against evil,\n",
      "yesterday. When is it dated? But no matter; don’t stay to look; put it\n",
      "up carefully with mine and your own. Now, observe! I never doubted until\n",
      "within this hour or two, that he had, or could have such a paper. It is\n",

      "confirms me. He knows that a wood-sawyer, living by the prison wall,\n",
      "is under the control of the Defarges, and has been rehearsed by\n",
      "Madame Defarge as to his having seen Her”--he never mentioned Lucie’s\n",
      "name--“making signs and signals to prisoners. It is easy to foresee that\n",
      "the pretence will be the common one, a prison plot, and that it will\n",

      "until after to-morrow; probably not until two or three days afterwards;\n",
      "more probably a week afterwards. You know it is a capital crime, to\n",
      "mourn for, or sympathise with, a victim of the Guillotine. She and her\n",
      "father would unquestionably be guilty of this crime, and this woman (the\n",
      "inveteracy of whose pursuit cannot be described) would wait to add that\n",

      "to roll that afternoon on the life-tide of the city to the boundless\n",
      "everlasting sea. Before their cells were quit of them, new occupants\n",

      "and the frightful moral disorder, born of unspeakable suffering,\n",
      "intolerable oppression, and heartless indifference, smote equally\n",
      "without distinction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charles Darnay, alone in a cell, had sustained himself with no\n",
      "flattering delusion since he came to it from the Tribunal. In every line\n",
      "of the narrative he had heard, he had heard his condemnation. He had\n",
      "fully comprehended that no personal influence could possibly save him,\n",
      "that he was virtually sentenced by the millions, and that units could\n",
      "avail him nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, it was not easy, with the face of his beloved wife fresh\n",
      "before him, to compose his mind to what it must bear. His hold on life\n",
      "was strong, and it was very, very hard, to loosen; by gradual efforts\n",
      "and degrees unclosed a little here, it clenched the tighter there; and\n",
      "when he brought his strength to bear on that hand and it yielded,\n",
      "this was closed again. There was a hurry, too, in all his thoughts,\n",
      "a turbulent and heated working of his heart, that contended against\n",
      "resignation. If, for a moment, he did feel resigned, then his wife and\n",
      "child who had to live after him, seemed to protest and to make it a\n",
      "selfish thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, all this was at first. Before long, the consideration that there\n",
      "was no disgrace in the fate he must meet, and that numbers went the same\n",
      "road wrongfully, and trod it firmly every day, sprang up to stimulate\n",
      "him. Next followed the thought that much of the future peace of mind\n",
      "enjoyable by the dear ones, depended on his quiet fortitude. So,\n",
      "by degrees he calmed into the better state, when he could raise his\n",

      "\n",
      "Before it had set in dark on the night of his condemnation, he had\n",
      "travelled thus far on his last way. Being allowed to purchase the means\n",
      "of writing, and a light, he sat down to write until such time as the\n",
      "prison lamps should be extinguished.\n",
      "\n",
      "He wrote a long letter to Lucie, showing her that he had known nothing\n",
      "of her father’s imprisonment, until he had heard of it from herself,\n",
      "and that he had been as ignorant as she of his father’s and uncle’s\n",
      "responsibility for that misery, until the paper had been read. He had\n",
      "already explained to her that his concealment from herself of the name\n",
      "he had relinquished, was the one condition--fully intelligible now--that\n",
      "her father had attached to their betrothal, and was the one promise he\n",
      "had still exacted on the morning of their marriage. He entreated her,\n",
      "for her father’s sake, never to seek to know whether her father had\n",
      "become oblivious of the existence of the paper, or had had it recalled\n",
      "to him (for the moment, or for good), by the story of the Tower, on\n",
      "that old Sunday under the dear old plane-tree in the garden. If he had\n",

      "mention of it among the relics of prisoners which the populace had\n",
      "discovered there, and which had been described to all the world. He\n",
      "besought her--though he added that he knew it was needless--to console\n",
      "her father, by impressing him through every tender means she could think\n",
      "of, with the truth that he had done nothing for which he could justly\n",
      "reproach himself, but had uniformly forgotten himself for their joint\n",
      "sakes. Next to her preservation of his own last grateful love and\n",
      "blessing, and her overcoming of her sorrow, to devote herself to their\n",

      "tending.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Mr. Lorry, he commended them all, and explained his worldly affairs.\n",
      "That done, with many added sentences of grateful friendship and warm\n",
      "attachment, all was done. He never thought of Carton. His mind was so\n",
      "full of the others, that he never once thought of him.\n",
      "\n",

      "suffered, and had come back to her, dead and at peace, and yet there\n",
      "was no difference in him. Another pause of oblivion, and he awoke in the\n",

      "\n",
      "“I was weak and faint when you brought me in, and I am fainter now you\n",

      "moments now? Take him yourself to the courtyard you know of, place\n",
      "him yourself in the carriage, show him yourself to Mr. Lorry, tell him\n",

      "last night, and his promise of last night, and drive away!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spy withdrew, and Carton seated himself at the table, resting his\n",
      "forehead on his hands. The Spy returned immediately, with two men.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How, then?” said one of them, contemplating the fallen figure. “So\n",
      "afflicted to find that his friend has drawn a prize in the lottery of\n",
      "Sainte Guillotine?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A good patriot,” said the other, “could hardly have been more afflicted\n",
      "if the Aristocrat had drawn a blank.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They raised the unconscious figure, placed it on a litter they had\n",
      "brought to the door, and bent to carry it away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The time is short, Evrémonde,” said the Spy, in a warning voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know it well,” answered Carton. “Be careful of my friend, I entreat\n",
      "you, and leave me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, then, my children,” said Barsad. “Lift him, and come away!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The door closed, and Carton was left alone. Straining his powers of\n",
      "listening to the utmost, he listened for any sound that might denote\n",
      "suspicion or alarm. There was none. Keys turned, doors clashed,\n",
      "footsteps passed along distant passages: no cry was raised, or hurry\n",
      "made, that seemed unusual. Breathing more freely in a little while, he\n",
      "sat down at the table, and listened again until the clock struck Two.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sounds that he was not afraid of, for he divined their meaning, then\n",
      "began to be audible. Several doors were opened in succession, and\n",
      "finally his own. A gaoler, with a list in his hand, looked in, merely\n",
      "saying, “Follow me, Evrémonde!” and he followed into a large dark room,\n",
      "at a distance. It was a dark winter day, and what with the shadows\n",
      "within, and what with the shadows without, he could but dimly discern\n",
      "the others who were brought there to have their arms bound. Some were\n",
      "standing; some seated. Some were lamenting, and in restless motion;\n",
      "but, these were few. The great majority were silent and still, looking\n",
      "fixedly at the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he stood by the wall in a dim corner, while some of the fifty-two\n",
      "were brought in after him, one man stopped in passing, to embrace him,\n",
      "as having a knowledge of him. It thrilled him with a great dread of\n",
      "discovery; but the man went on. A very few moments after that, a young\n",
      "woman, with a slight girlish form, a sweet spare face in which there was\n",
      "no vestige of colour, and large widely opened patient eyes, rose from\n",
      "the seat where he had observed her sitting, and came to speak to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Citizen Evrémonde,” she said, touching him with her cold hand. “I am a\n",
      "poor little seamstress, who was with you in La Force.”\n",

      "Jacques Three of the Revolutionary Jury. Not in the wine-shop did Madame\n",
      "Defarge confer with these ministers, but in the shed of the wood-sawyer,\n",
      "erst a mender of roads. The sawyer himself did not participate in the\n",
      "conference, but abided at a little distance, like an outer satellite who\n",
      "was not to speak until required, or to offer an opinion until invited.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But our Defarge,” said Jacques Three, “is undoubtedly a good\n",
      "Republican? Eh?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is no better,” the voluble Vengeance protested in her shrill\n",
      "notes, “in France.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Peace, little Vengeance,” said Madame Defarge, laying her hand with\n",
      "a slight frown on her lieutenant’s lips, “hear me speak. My husband,\n",
      "fellow-citizen, is a good Republican and a bold man; he has deserved\n",
      "well of the Republic, and possesses its confidence. But my husband has\n",
      "his weaknesses, and he is so weak as to relent towards this Doctor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is a great pity,” croaked Jacques Three, dubiously shaking his head,\n",
      "with his cruel fingers at his hungry mouth; “it is not quite like a good\n",
      "citizen; it is a thing to regret.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“See you,” said madame, “I care nothing for this Doctor, I. He may wear\n",
      "his head or lose it, for any interest I have in him; it is all one to\n",
      "me. But, the Evrémonde people are to be exterminated, and the wife and\n",
      "child must follow the husband and father.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She has a fine head for it,” croaked Jacques Three. “I have seen blue\n",
      "eyes and golden hair there, and they looked charming when Samson held\n",
      "them up.” Ogre that he was, he spoke like an epicure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge cast down her eyes, and reflected a little.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The child also,” observed Jacques Three, with a meditative enjoyment\n",
      "of his words, “has golden hair and blue eyes. And we seldom have a child\n",
      "there. It is a pretty sight!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In a word,” said Madame Defarge, coming out of her short abstraction,\n",
      "“I cannot trust my husband in this matter. Not only do I feel, since\n",
      "last night, that I dare not confide to him the details of my projects;\n",
      "but also I feel that if I delay, there is danger of his giving warning,\n",
      "and then they might escape.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That must never be,” croaked Jacques Three; “no one must escape. We\n",
      "have not half enough as it is. We ought to have six score a day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In a word,” Madame Defarge went on, “my husband has not my reason for\n",
      "pursuing this family to annihilation, and I have not his reason for\n",
      "regarding this Doctor with any sensibility. I must act for myself,\n",
      "therefore. Come hither, little citizen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The wood-sawyer, who held her in the respect, and himself in the\n",
      "submission, of mortal fear, advanced with his hand to his red cap.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Touching those signals, little citizen,” said Madame Defarge, sternly,\n",
      "“that she made to the prisoners; you are ready to bear witness to them\n",
      "this very day?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay, ay, why not!” cried the sawyer. “Every day, in all weathers, from\n",
      "two to four, always signalling, sometimes with the little one, sometimes\n",
      "without. I know what I know. I have seen with my eyes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He made all manner of gestures while he spoke, as if in incidental\n",
      "imitation of some few of the great diversity of signals that he had\n",
      "never seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Clearly plots,” said Jacques Three. “Transparently!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is no doubt of the Jury?” inquired Madame Defarge, letting her\n",
      "eyes turn to him with a gloomy smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Rely upon the patriotic Jury, dear citizeness. I answer for my\n",
      "fellow-Jurymen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, let me see,” said Madame Defarge, pondering again. “Yet once more!\n",
      "Can I spare this Doctor to my husband? I have no feeling either way. Can\n",
      "I spare him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He would count as one head,” observed Jacques Three, in a low voice.\n",
      "“We really have not heads enough; it would be a pity, I think.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He was signalling with her when I saw her,” argued Madame Defarge; “I\n",
      "cannot speak of one without the other; and I must not be silent, and\n",
      "trust the case wholly to him, this little citizen here. For, I am not a\n",
      "bad witness.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Vengeance and Jacques Three vied with each other in their fervent\n",
      "protestations that she was the most admirable and marvellous of\n",
      "witnesses. The little citizen, not to be outdone, declared her to be a\n",
      "celestial witness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He must take his chance,” said Madame Defarge. “No, I cannot spare\n",
      "him! You are engaged at three o’clock; you are going to see the batch of\n",
      "to-day executed.--You?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The question was addressed to the wood-sawyer, who hurriedly replied in\n",
      "the affirmative: seizing the occasion to add that he was the most ardent\n",
      "of Republicans, and that he would be in effect the most desolate of\n",
      "Republicans, if anything prevented him from enjoying the pleasure of\n",
      "smoking his afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll national\n",
      "barber. He was so very demonstrative herein, that he might have been\n",
      "suspected (perhaps was, by the dark eyes that looked contemptuously at\n",
      "him out of Madame Defarge’s head) of having his small individual fears\n",
      "for his own personal safety, every hour in the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I,” said madame, “am equally engaged at the same place. After it is\n",
      "over--say at eight to-night--come you to me, in Saint Antoine, and we\n",
      "will give information against these people at my Section.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The wood-sawyer said he would be proud and flattered to attend the\n",
      "citizeness. The citizeness looking at him, he became embarrassed, evaded\n",
      "her glance as a small dog would have done, retreated among his wood, and\n",
      "hid his confusion over the handle of his saw.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge beckoned the Juryman and The Vengeance a little nearer to\n",
      "the door, and there expounded her further views to them thus:\n",
      "\n",
      "“She will now be at home, awaiting the moment of his death. She will\n",
      "be mourning and grieving. She will be in a state of mind to impeach the\n",
      "justice of the Republic. She will be full of sympathy with its enemies.\n",
      "I will go to her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What an admirable woman; what an adorable woman!” exclaimed Jacques\n",
      "Three, rapturously. “Ah, my cherished!” cried The Vengeance; and\n",
      "embraced her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Take you my knitting,” said Madame Defarge, placing it in her\n",
      "lieutenant’s hands, “and have it ready for me in my usual seat. Keep\n",
      "me my usual chair. Go you there, straight, for there will probably be a\n",
      "greater concourse than usual, to-day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I willingly obey the orders of my Chief,” said The Vengeance with\n",
      "alacrity, and kissing her cheek. “You will not be late?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall be there before the commencement.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And before the tumbrils arrive. Be sure you are there, my soul,” said\n",
      "The Vengeance, calling after her, for she had already turned into the\n",
      "street, “before the tumbrils arrive!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge slightly waved her hand, to imply that she heard, and\n",
      "might be relied upon to arrive in good time, and so went through the\n",
      "mud, and round the corner of the prison wall. The Vengeance and the\n",
      "Juryman, looking after her as she walked away, were highly appreciative\n",
      "of her fine figure, and her superb moral endowments.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were many women at that time, upon whom the time laid a dreadfully\n",
      "disfiguring hand; but, there was not one among them more to be dreaded\n",
      "than this ruthless woman, now taking her way along the streets. Of a\n",
      "strong and fearless character, of shrewd sense and readiness, of great\n",
      "determination, of that kind of beauty which not only seems to impart\n",
      "to its possessor firmness and animosity, but to strike into others an\n",
      "instinctive recognition of those qualities; the troubled time would have\n",
      "heaved her up, under any circumstances. But, imbued from her childhood\n",
      "with a brooding sense of wrong, and an inveterate hatred of a class,\n",
      "opportunity had developed her into a tigress. She was absolutely without\n",
      "pity. If she had ever had the virtue in her, it had quite gone out of\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was nothing to her, that an innocent man was to die for the sins of\n",
      "his forefathers; she saw, not him, but them. It was nothing to her, that\n",
      "his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan; that was\n",
      "insufficient punishment, because they were her natural enemies and\n",
      "her prey, and as such had no right to live. To appeal to her, was made\n",
      "hopeless by her having no sense of pity, even for herself. If she had\n",
      "been laid low in the streets, in any of the many encounters in which\n",
      "she had been engaged, she would not have pitied herself; nor, if she had\n",
      "been ordered to the axe to-morrow, would she have gone to it with any\n",
      "softer feeling than a fierce desire to change places with the man who\n",
      "sent her there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a heart Madame Defarge carried under her rough robe. Carelessly\n",
      "worn, it was a becoming robe enough, in a certain weird way, and her\n",
      "dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap. Lying hidden in her\n",
      "bosom, was a loaded pistol. Lying hidden at her waist, was a sharpened\n",
      "dagger. Thus accoutred, and walking with the confident tread of such\n",
      "a character, and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually\n",
      "walked in her girlhood, bare-foot and bare-legged, on the brown\n",
      "sea-sand, Madame Defarge took her way along the streets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, when the journey of the travelling coach, at that very moment\n",
      "waiting for the completion of its load, had been planned out last night,\n",
      "the difficulty of taking Miss Pross in it had much engaged Mr. Lorry’s\n",
      "attention. It was not merely desirable to avoid overloading the coach,\n",
      "but it was of the highest importance that the time occupied in examining\n",
      "it and its passengers, should be reduced to the utmost; since their\n",
      "escape might depend on the saving of only a few seconds here and there.\n",
      "Finally, he had proposed, after anxious consideration, that Miss Pross\n",
      "and Jerry, who were at liberty to leave the city, should leave it at\n",
      "three o’clock in the lightest-wheeled conveyance known to that period.\n",
      "Unencumbered with luggage, they would soon overtake the coach, and,\n",
      "passing it and preceding it on the road, would order its horses in\n",
      "advance, and greatly facilitate its progress during the precious hours\n",
      "of the night, when delay was the most to be dreaded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that\n",
      "pressing emergency, Miss Pross hailed it with joy. She and Jerry had\n",
      "beheld the coach start, had known who it was that Solomon brought, had\n",
      "passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense, and were now concluding\n",
      "their arrangements to follow the coach, even as Madame Defarge,\n",
      "taking her way through the streets, now drew nearer and nearer to the\n",
      "else-deserted lodging in which they held their consultation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now what do you think, Mr. Cruncher,” said Miss Pross, whose agitation\n",
      "was so great that she could hardly speak, or stand, or move, or live:\n",
      "“what do you think of our not starting from this courtyard? Another\n",
      "carriage having already gone from here to-day, it might awaken\n",
      "suspicion.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My opinion, miss,” returned Mr. Cruncher, “is as you’re right. Likewise\n",
      "wot I’ll stand by you, right or wrong.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious creatures,” said\n",
      "Miss Pross, wildly crying, “that I am incapable of forming any plan. Are\n",
      "_you_ capable of forming any plan, my dear good Mr. Cruncher?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Respectin’ a future spear o’ life, miss,” returned Mr. Cruncher, “I\n",
      "hope so. Respectin’ any present use o’ this here blessed old head o’\n",
      "mine, I think not. Would you do me the favour, miss, to take notice o’\n",
      "two promises and wows wot it is my wishes fur to record in this here\n",
      "crisis?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, for gracious sake!” cried Miss Pross, still wildly crying, “record\n",
      "them at once, and get them out of the way, like an excellent man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“First,” said Mr. Cruncher, who was all in a tremble, and who spoke with\n",
      "an ashy and solemn visage, “them poor things well out o’ this, never no\n",
      "more will I do it, never no more!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am quite sure, Mr. Cruncher,” returned Miss Pross, “that you\n",
      "never will do it again, whatever it is, and I beg you not to think it\n",
      "necessary to mention more particularly what it is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, miss,” returned Jerry, “it shall not be named to you. Second: them\n",
      "poor things well out o’ this, and never no more will I interfere with\n",
      "Mrs. Cruncher’s flopping, never no more!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Whatever housekeeping arrangement that may be,” said Miss Pross,\n",
      "striving to dry her eyes and compose herself, “I have no doubt it\n",
      "is best that Mrs. Cruncher should have it entirely under her own\n",
      "superintendence.--O my poor darlings!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I go so far as to say, miss, moreover,” proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with a\n",
      "most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpit--“and let my words\n",
      "be took down and took to Mrs. Cruncher through yourself--that wot my\n",
      "opinions respectin’ flopping has undergone a change, and that wot I only\n",
      "hope with all my heart as Mrs. Cruncher may be a flopping at the present\n",
      "time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There, there, there! I hope she is, my dear man,” cried the distracted\n",
      "Miss Pross, “and I hope she finds it answering her expectations.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Forbid it,” proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with additional solemnity,\n",
      "additional slowness, and additional tendency to hold forth and hold\n",
      "out, “as anything wot I have ever said or done should be wisited on my\n",
      "earnest wishes for them poor creeturs now! Forbid it as we shouldn’t all\n",
      "flop (if it was anyways conwenient) to get ’em out o’ this here dismal\n",
      "risk! Forbid it, miss! Wot I say, for-_bid_ it!” This was Mr. Cruncher’s\n",
      "conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to find a better one.\n",
      "\n",
      "And still Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came\n",
      "nearer and nearer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If we ever get back to our native land,” said Miss Pross, “you may rely\n",
      "upon my telling Mrs. Cruncher as much as I may be able to remember and\n",
      "understand of what you have so impressively said; and at all events\n",
      "you may be sure that I shall bear witness to your being thoroughly in\n",
      "earnest at this dreadful time. Now, pray let us think! My esteemed Mr.\n",
      "Cruncher, let us think!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came nearer\n",
      "and nearer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you were to go before,” said Miss Pross, “and stop the vehicle and\n",
      "horses from coming here, and were to wait somewhere for me; wouldn’t\n",
      "that be best?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher thought it might be best.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where could you wait for me?” asked Miss Pross.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but\n",
      "Temple Bar. Alas! Temple Bar was hundreds of miles away, and Madame\n",
      "Defarge was drawing very near indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“By the cathedral door,” said Miss Pross. “Would it be much out of\n",
      "the way, to take me in, near the great cathedral door between the two\n",
      "towers?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, miss,” answered Mr. Cruncher.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then, like the best of men,” said Miss Pross, “go to the posting-house\n",
      "straight, and make that change.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am doubtful,” said Mr. Cruncher, hesitating and shaking his head,\n",
      "“about leaving of you, you see. We don’t know what may happen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Heaven knows we don’t,” returned Miss Pross, “but have no fear for me.\n",
      "Take me in at the cathedral, at Three o’Clock, or as near it as you can,\n",
      "and I am sure it will be better than our going from here. I feel certain\n",
      "of it. There! Bless you, Mr. Cruncher! Think-not of me, but of the lives\n",
      "that may depend on both of us!”\n",
      "\n",
      "This exordium, and Miss Pross’s two hands in quite agonised entreaty\n",
      "clasping his, decided Mr. Cruncher. With an encouraging nod or two, he\n",
      "immediately went out to alter the arrangements, and left her by herself\n",
      "to follow as she had proposed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The having originated a precaution which was already in course of\n",
      "execution, was a great relief to Miss Pross. The necessity of composing\n",
      "her appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the\n",
      "streets, was another relief. She looked at her watch, and it was twenty\n",
      "minutes past two. She had no time to lose, but must get ready at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Afraid, in her extreme perturbation, of the loneliness of the deserted\n",
      "rooms, and of half-imagined faces peeping from behind every open door\n",
      "in them, Miss Pross got a basin of cold water and began laving her eyes,\n",
      "which were swollen and red. Haunted by her feverish apprehensions, she\n",
      "could not bear to have her sight obscured for a minute at a time by the\n",
      "dripping water, but constantly paused and looked round to see that there\n",
      "was no one watching her. In one of those pauses she recoiled and cried\n",
      "out, for she saw a figure standing in the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "The basin fell to the ground broken, and the water flowed to the feet of\n",
      "Madame Defarge. By strange stern ways, and through much staining blood,\n",
      "those feet had come to meet that water.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge looked coldly at her, and said, “The wife of Evrémonde;\n",
      "where is she?”\n",
      "\n",
      "It flashed upon Miss Pross’s mind that the doors were all standing open,\n",
      "and would suggest the flight. Her first act was to shut them. There were\n",
      "four in the room, and she shut them all. She then placed herself before\n",
      "the door of the chamber which Lucie had occupied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge’s dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement,\n",
      "and rested on her when it was finished. Miss Pross had nothing beautiful\n",
      "about her; years had not tamed the wildness, or softened the grimness,\n",
      "of her appearance; but, she too was a determined woman in her different\n",
      "way, and she measured Madame Defarge with her eyes, every inch.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You might, from your appearance, be the wife of Lucifer,” said Miss\n",
      "Pross, in her breathing. “Nevertheless, you shall not get the better of\n",
      "me. I am an Englishwoman.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge looked at her scornfully, but still with something of\n",
      "Miss Pross’s own perception that they two were at bay. She saw a tight,\n",
      "hard, wiry woman before her, as Mr. Lorry had seen in the same figure a\n",
      "woman with a strong hand, in the years gone by. She knew full well that\n",
      "Miss Pross was the family’s devoted friend; Miss Pross knew full well\n",
      "that Madame Defarge was the family’s malevolent enemy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“On my way yonder,” said Madame Defarge, with a slight movement of\n",
      "her hand towards the fatal spot, “where they reserve my chair and my\n",
      "knitting for me, I am come to make my compliments to her in passing. I\n",
      "wish to see her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know that your intentions are evil,” said Miss Pross, “and you may\n",
      "depend upon it, I’ll hold my own against them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Each spoke in her own language; neither understood the other’s words;\n",
      "both were very watchful, and intent to deduce from look and manner, what\n",
      "the unintelligible words meant.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this\n",
      "moment,” said Madame Defarge. “Good patriots will know what that means.\n",
      "Let me see her. Go tell her that I wish to see her. Do you hear?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If those eyes of yours were bed-winches,” returned Miss Pross, “and I\n",
      "was an English four-poster, they shouldn’t loose a splinter of me. No,\n",
      "you wicked foreign woman; I am your match.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in\n",
      "detail; but, she so far understood them as to perceive that she was set\n",
      "at naught.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Woman imbecile and pig-like!” said Madame Defarge, frowning. “I take no\n",
      "answer from you. I demand to see her. Either tell her that I demand\n",
      "to see her, or stand out of the way of the door and let me go to her!”\n",
      " This, with an angry explanatory wave of her right arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I little thought,” said Miss Pross, “that I should ever want to\n",
      "understand your nonsensical language; but I would give all I have,\n",
      "except the clothes I wear, to know whether you suspect the truth, or any\n",
      "part of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither of them for a single moment released the other’s eyes. Madame\n",
      "Defarge had not moved from the spot where she stood when Miss Pross\n",
      "first became aware of her; but, she now advanced one step.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am a Briton,” said Miss Pross, “I am desperate. I don’t care an\n",
      "English Twopence for myself. I know that the longer I keep you here, the\n",
      "greater hope there is for my Ladybird. I’ll not leave a handful of that\n",
      "dark hair upon your head, if you lay a finger on me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus Miss Pross, with a shake of her head and a flash of her eyes\n",
      "between every rapid sentence, and every rapid sentence a whole breath.\n",
      "Thus Miss Pross, who had never struck a blow in her life.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought the\n",
      "irrepressible tears into her eyes. This was a courage that Madame\n",
      "Defarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness. “Ha, ha!” she\n",
      "laughed, “you poor wretch! What are you worth! I address myself to that\n",
      "Doctor.” Then she raised her voice and called out, “Citizen Doctor! Wife\n",
      "of Evrémonde! Child of Evrémonde! Any person but this miserable fool,\n",
      "answer the Citizeness Defarge!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps the following silence, perhaps some latent disclosure in the\n",
      "expression of Miss Pross’s face, perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from\n",
      "either suggestion, whispered to Madame Defarge that they were gone.\n",
      "Three of the doors she opened swiftly, and looked in.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Those rooms are all in disorder, there has been hurried packing, there\n",
      "are odds and ends upon the ground. There is no one in that room behind\n",
      "you! Let me look.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never!” said Miss Pross, who understood the request as perfectly as\n",
      "Madame Defarge understood the answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If they are not in that room, they are gone, and can be pursued and\n",
      "brought back,” said Madame Defarge to herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As long as you don’t know whether they are in that room or not, you are\n",
      "uncertain what to do,” said Miss Pross to herself; “and you shall not\n",
      "know that, if I can prevent your knowing it; and know that, or not know\n",
      "that, you shall not leave here while I can hold you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have been in the streets from the first, nothing has stopped me,\n",
      "I will tear you to pieces, but I will have you from that door,” said\n",
      "Madame Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are alone at the top of a high house in a solitary courtyard, we are\n",
      "not likely to be heard, and I pray for bodily strength to keep you here,\n",
      "while every minute you are here is worth a hundred thousand guineas to\n",
      "my darling,” said Miss Pross.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge made at the door. Miss Pross, on the instinct of the\n",
      "moment, seized her round the waist in both her arms, and held her tight.\n",
      "It was in vain for Madame Defarge to struggle and to strike; Miss Pross,\n",
      "with the vigorous tenacity of love, always so much stronger than hate,\n",
      "clasped her tight, and even lifted her from the floor in the struggle\n",
      "that they had. The two hands of Madame Defarge buffeted and tore her\n",
      "face; but, Miss Pross, with her head down, held her round the waist, and\n",
      "clung to her with more than the hold of a drowning woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon, Madame Defarge’s hands ceased to strike, and felt at her encircled\n",
      "waist. “It is under my arm,” said Miss Pross, in smothered tones, “you\n",
      "shall not draw it. I am stronger than you, I bless Heaven for it. I hold\n",
      "you till one or other of us faints or dies!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge’s hands were at her bosom. Miss Pross looked up, saw\n",
      "what it was, struck at it, struck out a flash and a crash, and stood\n",
      "alone--blinded with smoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this was in a second. As the smoke cleared, leaving an awful\n",
      "stillness, it passed out on the air, like the soul of the furious woman\n",
      "whose body lay lifeless on the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first fright and horror of her situation, Miss Pross passed the\n",
      "body as far from it as she could, and ran down the stairs to call for\n",
      "fruitless help. Happily, she bethought herself of the consequences of\n",
      "what she did, in time to check herself and go back. It was dreadful to\n",
      "go in at the door again; but, she did go in, and even went near it, to\n",
      "get the bonnet and other things that she must wear. These she put on,\n",
      "out on the staircase, first shutting and locking the door and taking\n",
      "away the key. She then sat down on the stairs a few moments to breathe\n",
      "and to cry, and then got up and hurried away.\n",
      "\n",
      "By good fortune she had a veil on her bonnet, or she could hardly have\n",
      "gone along the streets without being stopped. By good fortune, too, she\n",
      "was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show disfigurement\n",
      "like any other woman. She needed both advantages, for the marks of\n",
      "gripping fingers were deep in her face, and her hair was torn, and her\n",
      "dress (hastily composed with unsteady hands) was clutched and dragged a\n",
      "hundred ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "In crossing the bridge, she dropped the door key in the river. Arriving\n",
      "at the cathedral some few minutes before her escort, and waiting there,\n",
      "she thought, what if the key were already taken in a net, what if\n",
      "it were identified, what if the door were opened and the remains\n",
      "discovered, what if she were stopped at the gate, sent to prison, and\n",
      "charged with murder! In the midst of these fluttering thoughts, the\n",
      "escort appeared, took her in, and took her away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is there any noise in the streets?” she asked him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The usual noises,” Mr. Cruncher replied; and looked surprised by the\n",
      "question and by her aspect.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t hear you,” said Miss Pross. “What do you say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was in vain for Mr. Cruncher to repeat what he said; Miss Pross could\n",
      "not hear him. “So I’ll nod my head,” thought Mr. Cruncher, amazed, “at\n",
      "all events she’ll see that.” And she did.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is there any noise in the streets now?” asked Miss Pross again,\n",
      "presently.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again Mr. Cruncher nodded his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t hear it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gone deaf in an hour?” said Mr. Cruncher, ruminating, with his mind\n",
      "much disturbed; “wot’s come to her?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I feel,” said Miss Pross, “as if there had been a flash and a crash,\n",
      "and that crash was the last thing I should ever hear in this life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Blest if she ain’t in a queer condition!” said Mr. Cruncher, more and\n",
      "more disturbed. “Wot can she have been a takin’, to keep her courage up?\n",
      "Hark! There’s the roll of them dreadful carts! You can hear that, miss?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can hear,” said Miss Pross, seeing that he spoke to her, “nothing. O,\n",
      "my good man, there was first a great crash, and then a great stillness,\n",
      "and that stillness seems to be fixed and unchangeable, never to be\n",
      "broken any more as long as my life lasts.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If she don’t hear the roll of those dreadful carts, now very nigh their\n",
      "journey’s end,” said Mr. Cruncher, glancing over his shoulder, “it’s my\n",
      "opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in this world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And indeed she never did.\n",

      "Along the Paris streets, the death-carts rumble, hollow and harsh. Six\n",
      "tumbrils carry the day’s wine to La Guillotine. All the devouring and\n",
      "insatiate Monsters imagined since imagination could record itself,\n",
      "are fused in the one realisation, Guillotine. And yet there is not in\n",
      "France, with its rich variety of soil and climate, a blade, a leaf,\n",
      "a root, a sprig, a peppercorn, which will grow to maturity under\n",
      "conditions more certain than those that have produced this horror. Crush\n",
      "humanity out of shape once more, under similar hammers, and it will\n",
      "twist itself into the same tortured forms. Sow the same seed of\n",
      "rapacious license and oppression over again, and it will surely yield\n",
      "the same fruit according to its kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Six tumbrils roll along the streets. Change these back again to what\n",
      "they were, thou powerful enchanter, Time, and they shall be seen to be\n",
      "the carriages of absolute monarchs, the equipages of feudal nobles, the\n",
      "toilettes of flaring Jezebels, the churches that are not my father’s\n",
      "house but dens of thieves, the huts of millions of starving peasants!\n",
      "No; the great magician who majestically works out the appointed order\n",
      "of the Creator, never reverses his transformations. “If thou be changed\n",
      "into this shape by the will of God,” say the seers to the enchanted, in\n",
      "the wise Arabian stories, “then remain so! But, if thou wear this\n",
      "form through mere passing conjuration, then resume thy former aspect!”\n",
      " Changeless and hopeless, the tumbrils roll along.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the sombre wheels of the six carts go round, they seem to plough up\n",
      "a long crooked furrow among the populace in the streets. Ridges of faces\n",
      "are thrown to this side and to that, and the ploughs go steadily onward.\n",
      "So used are the regular inhabitants of the houses to the spectacle, that\n",
      "in many windows there are no people, and in some the occupation of the\n",
      "hands is not so much as suspended, while the eyes survey the faces in\n",
      "the tumbrils. Here and there, the inmate has visitors to see the sight;\n",
      "then he points his finger, with something of the complacency of a\n",
      "curator or authorised exponent, to this cart and to this, and seems to\n",
      "tell who sat here yesterday, and who there the day before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the riders in the tumbrils, some observe these things, and all\n",
      "things on their last roadside, with an impassive stare; others, with\n",
      "a lingering interest in the ways of life and men. Some, seated with\n",
      "drooping heads, are sunk in silent despair; again, there are some so\n",
      "heedful of their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances as\n",
      "they have seen in theatres, and in pictures. Several close their eyes,\n",
      "and think, or try to get their straying thoughts together. Only one, and\n",
      "he a miserable creature, of a crazed aspect, is so shattered and made\n",
      "drunk by horror, that he sings, and tries to dance. Not one of the whole\n",
      "number appeals by look or gesture, to the pity of the people.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrils,\n",
      "and faces are often turned up to some of them, and they are asked some\n",
      "question. It would seem to be always the same question, for, it is\n",
      "always followed by a press of people towards the third cart. The\n",
      "horsemen abreast of that cart, frequently point out one man in it with\n",
      "their swords. The leading curiosity is, to know which is he; he stands\n",
      "at the back of the tumbril with his head bent down, to converse with a\n",
      "mere girl who sits on the side of the cart, and holds his hand. He has\n",
      "no curiosity or care for the scene about him, and always speaks to the\n",
      "girl. Here and there in the long street of St. Honore, cries are raised\n",
      "against him. If they move him at all, it is only to a quiet smile, as he\n",
      "shakes his hair a little more loosely about his face. He cannot easily\n",
      "touch his face, his arms being bound.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the steps of a church, awaiting the coming-up of the tumbrils, stands\n",
      "the Spy and prison-sheep. He looks into the first of them: not there.\n",
      "He looks into the second: not there. He already asks himself, “Has he\n",
      "sacrificed me?” when his face clears, as he looks into the third.\n",
      "\n",

      "still holds it as he promised. He gently places her with her back to the\n",
